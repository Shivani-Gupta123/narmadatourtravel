<h3><strong>Overview </strong></h3>

<h3><strong>History of Kumbh Mela </strong></h3>
<p>Before you embark on this spiritual journey, you must know what is the history behind it. The origin of Kumbh Mela is associated with the days when Devtas and the demons conjointly churn the ocean to get the nectar out of it and fight over it as described in the ancient <a href="https://www.pilgrimagetour.in/blog/hindu-texts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Hindu texts</a>. The story begins with Samudra Manthan (the churning of the ocean) when gods and demons churned the ocean to extract the nectar of immortality. When finally, the nectar is extracted, gods and demons start fighting over who will consume it first. During this celestial event, a few drops of Amrit or nectar fell at four places. These four places are Prayagraj, <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/haridwar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haridwar</a>, Ujjain, and Nashik and become the sacred sites where Kumbh Mela is organized. Over the centuries, Kumbh Mela continues to attract millions of pilgrims from across the world including monks, spiritual leaders, ascetics, and travelers.</p>
<h3><strong>Significance of Kumbh Mela </strong></h3>
<p>Prayagraj Kumbh Mela is a great spiritual gathering that holds immense significance for Hindus.

This bathing ritual is believed to wash away the sins of the person, leading him to Moksha or salvation and liberating him from the cycle of life and death. Apart from the spiritual aspect, Kumbh Mela offers a platform to religious scholars, yogis, saints, and spiritual leaders to share wisdom and encourage people to seek spiritual enlightenment. It is also a perfect place for someone, who wants to learn more about spirituality, Hindu culture, and ancient Indian traditions.</p>
