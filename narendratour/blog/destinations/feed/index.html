										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It had been a fantasy of mine since I was 10 years of age when I saw the shaded molded moving in the sky. I was constantly enthralled by riding in a hot air balloon high over some lovely nation. At that point, I thought what I&#8217;m sitting tight for? I have the opportunity to experience Hot Air Balloon ride in <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/sri-lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sri Lanka</a> in Dambulla, Sri Lanka!</p>
<p>Frequently when individuals <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/srilanka-tour-packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit Sri Lanka</a>, their lone goal is <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/exploring-colombo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colombo</a>. In any case, Sri Lanka isn&#8217;t finished without going to Dambulla. In the same way as other others, I had not known about Dambulla until the point when I came to explore Sri Lanka. This past January, my friend and I wandered on a very late excursion to Dambulla for our vacation. When I ventured off the transport I was interested in the view. I thought to myself, &#8220;This will be invigorating!&#8221; Little did I know, Dambulla would become the place where I overcame the fears holding me back and discovered a new sense of freedom in finding my true self.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9621" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla.jpg" alt="Hot Air Balloon Ride In Dambulla" width="900" height="500" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla-300x167.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla-768x427.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Most visitors wander here for the correct motivation behind hot air swelling, and that was my central goal as well. The morning began with a 5 am pick up from my inn, welcomed in the transport by the quieted and energized prattle of kindred inflatable riders effectively gathered. Landing at Universal Balloon HQ in obscurity, we were offered espresso and a breakfast spread while we sat tight for the breeze to drop to a sheltered level. The orderlies cautioned us there might be no flights that day – it&#8217;s constantly eccentric.</p>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Dambulla Hot Air Balloon Ride-The Anticipation</strong></h3>
<p>We woke the following morning to a stunning conventional Sri Lankan breakfast anticipating us. The most well-known dish in Dambulla is Beetroot Curry. The stew-like fixings are put into a pot in the broiler and heated for 2-3 hours. It&#8217;s conveyed to the table, aired out directly before you, and the final products are scrumptious. After breakfast, we continued to go on our Dambulla hot air expand ride.</p>
<p>After landing at our takeoff site, I was totally astonished seeing inflatables exploded and let go directly before me! At 6:30 AM, my eyes were opened to the beguiling locales of Dambulla hot air inflatables and the mystical, pixie-like stacks jabbing out into the horizon. My interest was started quickly. Like a tyke entering Walt Disney World out of the blue, I energetically rushed to get nearby of how the pilots were lighting the hot air inflatables. Before my Dambulla hot air balloon ride, I took a couple of previews of them. Seeing 35+ balloons float off at the same time into the sky appeared as though I had ventured into a fantasyland and a tall tale was anticipating me.</p>
<p>Much the same as Ariel in the Little Mermaid, I appreciate enterprises and was resolved to defeat any deterrents I may confront. It was astounding then that it took us this long to ride in a hot air balloon out of the blue. In any case, it was certainly justified regardless of the pause, particularly since we picked a standout amongst the most otherworldly places on the planet to influence this fantasy of our own come to genuine: Dambulla, Sri Lanka.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9620" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla-Sri-Lanka.jpg" alt="Hot Air Balloon Ride In Dambulla, Sri Lanka" width="900" height="575" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla-Sri-Lanka.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla-Sri-Lanka-300x192.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla-Sri-Lanka-768x491.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>A substantial Mercedes carry bus (tasteful, I know!) showed up outside our inn entryway at 6 a.m. on the dab, as guaranteed. We drove through the tight, twisting avenues of Dambulla, getting different visitors who looked an indistinguishable blend of languid and euphoric from we felt. We sat tight a bit for the pilots to check the climate. It was a decent sign that they weren&#8217;t going to fly with awful conditions, however, I was noiselessly crossing my fingers that they&#8217;d get the permission to fly. Furthermore, fortunate for us, they did! So we jumped on the bus indeed, this time went to the &#8220;platform&#8221;. (I don&#8217;t know whether that is the specialized term, however, it sounds cool!)</p>
<p>We truly didn&#8217;t comprehend what&#8217;s in store, as this was a first for the two of us. We went skydiving on our previous holiday, and bungee bouncing not long after. I thought about whether a hot air balloon ride would exhaust after those adrenaline-pumping high elevation exercises. Kid, was I off-base! Our pilot, moved the inflatable directly finished shake developments, up high and afterward down low once more. There were times I felt as though I could connect and touch the ground underneath, and others when my stomach completed a flip perceiving how high we&#8217;d risen. The ride was definitely not exhausting. The impression of drifting in an ocean of beautiful inflatables as the sun ascended in the sky was not at all like anything I&#8217;ve ever experienced before. I saw part of the way through the flight that my cheeks hurt from grinning the whole time, however, even that didn&#8217;t wipe the smile off my face.</p>

<h3><strong>Back On Strong Ground</strong></h3>
<p>We extremely comprehended what a specialist pilot is a point at which he handled the crate impeccably on a trailer stage behind a truck. How on the planet did he do that?! The arrival still boggles my brain. After everybody was on the strong ground, our pilot popped a few jugs of champagne and we had a celebratory toast while spouting about how astounding the previous hour had been. Everybody was all grins. How might you not be after a morning like we&#8217;d quite recently experienced?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>God’s own country- that’s what <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/kerala">Kerala</a> has always been. Naturally, a land so pretty that it beckons even the heavens into its premises deserves a capital city that is no less charming and exquisite. And Trivandrum is the place that remains steeped in pride in being the capital of this really magnificent of all states in India. Thiruvananthapuram or Trivandrum is as exotic a <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/kerala-tourist-attractions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tourist destination as Kerala</a> itself, earning it the epithet of the Evergreen City of India.</p>
<p>Indeed, residing in the plethora of natural wonders as it does, Trivandrum is no lesser a haven than the state it ‘capitalises on’. But even as a prime tourist destination, Trivandrum still harbours places that remain rare, in that they are less known names and lesser explored destinations. Here’s a list of rare places to visit in Trivandrum so that you dare to venture on the road less taken on your next Kerala travel sojourn-</p>

</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9591" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shanghumukham-Beach.jpg" alt="Shanghumukham Beach" width="900" height="551" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shanghumukham-Beach.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shanghumukham-Beach-300x184.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shanghumukham-Beach-768x470.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>While the entire expanse of Kerala abounds in beaches that make for really famous tourist destinations, it’s indeed a surprise that a sandy expanse as definitive as the Shanghumukham beach in Trivandrum remains only a rare phenomenon when it comes to being one of the must visit places with the typical touristry appeal. In its white sands and exclusivity, the beach really is a splendid place to be in- one where you can remain unfazed by the bustle of life as well as the clamour of existence.</p>
<p>An exquisite shoreline, vistas of serenity, beholding sunrise views and impeccable sunset experiences, there is no wonder of nature that Shanghumukham beach does not delight its visitors with. A very striking presence in this picturesque, isolated beach is an exemplary mermaid- the Sagarakanyaka &#8211; sculpted by renowned Indian sculptor Kanayi Kunhiraman. Also an exclusive location of the Arattu festival, the spectacular beach is undoubtedly a prime presence in the capital region of Kerala.</p>

<p>Poovar might be a tourist town in Trivandrum but it still remains among the rare places to visit given that it sits at a very southernmost point of the district. The magnificent beach that Poovar houses however is relatively well known. With its stunning natural beauty complemented perfectly by the pleasant weather, Poovar should make for a really ideal holiday detour. A pretty coastal village, more accurately an island, the view from Poovar encompasses the mighty Neyyar river confluencing into the vast expanse of the Arabian Sea. Naturally with the sea at sway, Poovar also sports a luxurious beach along the trails of its coconut palms lined glorious sands.</p>
<p>The rustic charm of Poovar complements perfectly the growing luxury appeal of its many star rated establishments, thereby presenting tourists with a delightful mix of the pristine and the pure, the elegant and the mesmerising. There’s diverse flora and fauna at play, while even the seemingly ordinary sights are no less spectacular; coconut groves, fishermen going about their chores, floating cottages- all present a picture of a heaven hitherto undiscovered. There’s even an alluring estuary nearby Poovar that remains resplendent also in the same relaxing vibe and natural abundance. In its yet unspoilt confines, Poovar harbours an aura that caters to every touristry desire- of the quaint and the peaceful as also of the picturesque and the magical.</p>

<p>An idyllic spot for a relaxing day out in the open, the Neyyar dam is a man-made wonder that makes for among the rare places to visit in Trivandrum. In fact, Neyyar is a lake cum dam that is built over the Neyyar River and makes for a really enthralling spot encompassed by the Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary. With the breathtaking Western Ghats as the backdrop, the Neyyar Dam makes for a really amazing picnic place.</p>
<p>The panoramic presence of the lake amidst the majestic standing of the dam makes this place a marvel in many wonders. Undisturbed by the chaos of the world and deep seated in its offering of splendid serenity and unbounded natural bounty, the region makes for a really enchanting place to while away your Trivandrum sojourn. There’s obviously rich flora and diverse fauna inhabiting this ecologically vibrant place.

<p>Among the most charming lakes in Kerala yet only a rare tourist attraction, the Veli Lake should certainly be among the list of places you would visit on a <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/trivandrum-tour-packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trip to Trivandrum</a>. Located some 12 kilometers away from the city, the tourist village is a really pretty destination with its locational nestling at the confluence of the Veli Lake and the Arabian Sea. In fact the village sits pretty exotically on the sand bar that separates the two water bodies and oversees therefore the crystal waters of the underlying lagoon.</p>
<p>There’s ample activities that you can indulge in the many waters that define the allure of Veli. In its splendid stretch of backwaters and the lush expanse of its many paddy fields, the scene is one of a breathtaking contrast on canvas. Shades of green as vivid as the strokes of blue define this quaint place that is a visual treat to savor in all its glory. A floating bridge and some amazing stone and grass sculptures further up the exotic quotient of this charming place that definitely is a worthy tourist attraction in all its exquisite offerings.</p>
<h3><strong>5- Kappil Backwater</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 7 km from Varkala.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Free (boat rides extra).</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 20-30 min drive from Varkala.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Walk along the estuary, enjoy sunsets, boat rides.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9587" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kappil-Backwater.jpg" alt="Kappil Backwater" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kappil-Backwater.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kappil-Backwater-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kappil-Backwater-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The Kappil backwaters aren’t exactly among the rare tourist places in Trivandrum but compared to how abundantly explored backwaters in Kerala tend to be, it does not exactly feature as one of the must visit attractions. Situated a mere 7 kilometers away from the very popular beach destination of Varkala, the sheen of the Kappil backwaters seem to remain mired in relative obscurity. In fact the majestic beauty of the backwaters together with the astounding expanse of the sea makes also the Kappil beach a tourist destination of unparalleled magnificence altogether. Amazing sunset and sunrise views further compound the beauty of this place that remains resplendent even in its largely relaxing vibe.</p>
<p>The Kappil Pozhi estuary that separates the sea from the backwaters makes for an amazing walkway, one where you can enjoy a leisurely stroll even as panoramic views and the gentle sea breeze soothes your body and soul. The coconut lined sandy strip makes for such a stunning view that the place remains one of the most photographed across Kerala! Reclusive in its touristry presence yet not in any way lacking in the appeal, hardly would you discover a beauty like Kappil even in your sojourn across the world.</p>
<h3><strong>6- Kowdiar Palace</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: Kowdiar, Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Not open to the public.</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: N/A.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Year-round.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 5 km from the city center.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Admire architecture from outside.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9404" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum.jpg" alt="Kowdiar Palace, Trivandrum" width="900" height="590" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum-768x503.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>That Kerala is mainly celebrated as a land of verdant greenery and swaying waters, of beachy allure and coastal glory perhaps explains why an architectural specimen as striking as the Kowdiar Palace in Trivandrum makes for among the rare places that tourists tend to visit. In its structure, the palace is a simple manifestation of architecture, yet it is by no means any less exemplary a specimen than other flamboyant illustrations. Even historically the Kowdiar Palace holds significance as Maharajah Sree Chithira Thirunal built it for the wedding of his only sister, Maharani Karthika Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi.</p>
<p>A really unique wooden structure, one that even boasts an elevator made of wood, the Kowdiar Palace makes for a grand sight even in its ‘rooted’ existence. A three storeyed building that rears its majestic bearings from among the verdant expanse of Trivandrum, the palace is a lofty sight with its six steeples and an equally breathtaking wonder in the picturesque garden of greenery that nestles it. The Kowdiar Palace indeed is an encompassment of the simplicity that describes Kerala, flamboyant in its natural endowment and alluring even in its minimalism. There truly is no ode to beauty that does Trivandrum better humanly than the Kowdiar Palace.</p>
<h3><strong>7- Azhimala Beach</strong></h3>

<p>Azhimala might be another of the many beaches that dot Kerala but in its quiet splendor it remains one of those rare places that needs to be a feature of the itinerary of every visit to Trivandrum. Just some few kilometers away from the world class appeal of Kovalam, the allure of Azhimala resides in its quaint, calm existence that renders it nothing short of a paradise. The setting is one that is undoubtedly idyllic, the vibe permeating through its serene prettiness speaks of solace and contentment, and in the expanse of almost nothingness would you encounter a peace so alluring that you would want to stay there forever. Of course there are coconut fringed shores that sit pretty daintily with the majestic Azhimala hill as the backdrop. There also is the Azhimala Shiva Temple nearby for you to seek spirituality in, intermingled with solace and tranquility.</p>
<h3><strong>8- Bonacaud</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 40 km from Trivandrum, in the Agasthya Hills.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Free (trekking requires permission).</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 1.5–2 hours drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Trekking, visit tea estate, explore waterfalls.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9586" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bonacaud-Estate.jpg" alt="Bonacaud Estate" width="900" height="518" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bonacaud-Estate.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bonacaud-Estate-300x173.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bonacaud-Estate-768x442.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>A small village hamlet in Trivandrum, Bonacaud is also a really pretty picnic spot. A sprawling encompassment of natural beauty in its array of valleys, waterfalls and hills, Bonacaud also is the lesser known base station of the famous peak, Agasthyarkoodam in the Agasthya hills of the Western Ghats. What however strikes a different tone amidst the abundant beauty and verdance tract that defines every aspect of Kerala and also bonacaud is the presence of supposedly among the most haunted places in the state. That’s a chill that the Bonacaud Bungalow encompasses, that in its misty presence and obscure existence stands very much as a ghostly ground. There also however exists an abandoned tea factory that also adds its own dose of horror to Bonacaud.</p>
<p>Naturally in its abundant peaks and trails, Bonacaud is also a trekker’s paradise. Flora and fauna dot the region as does gurgling streams and crystal waters making it the true encompassment of nature in all its vibrancy. Bonacaud perhaps is no different than any other touristry attractions in Kerala, yet it remains one of the rare places to visit in Trivandrum if you are a soul forever in awe of as much of natural exuberance as the world can grant.</p>
<h3><strong>9- Muthalapozhi</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 29 km from Trivandrum.</li>

<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 45 min drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Visit estuary, sunset views, beach walks</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9588" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Muthalapozhi-Port.jpg" alt="Muthalapozhi Port" width="900" height="580" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Muthalapozhi-Port.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Muthalapozhi-Port-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Muthalapozhi-Port-768x495.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>A seaside village that rests just 29 kilometers away from the city of Trivandrum, Muthalapozhi might not strike exactly as a tourist wonder with its seemingly ordinary stature which is why it finds expression as one of the rare places to visit in Trivandrum. But as the place that defines the confluence of the Vamanapuram River and the Arabian Sea, the sleepy hamlet sure is no walkover either. Like all other places that emerge to be prettier with the merge of the backwaters and the sea, Muthalapozhi also is steeped in all of that exquisite beauty. An unending seascape, really stunning sunset views, an array of beach activities and unending allure of serenity- Trivandrum sure couldn’t have got any more ordinarily exotic than this!</p>

<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 2-hour drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Trekking, visit tea gardens, photography.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9594" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ponmudi.jpg" alt="Ponmudi" width="900" height="519" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ponmudi.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ponmudi-300x173.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ponmudi-768x443.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Ponmudi might be exactly the rarest of places to visit for a tourist, but as a hill station with all the charms it still dwells somewhere in obscurity.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an inexplicable aura in mystery, some sort of thrill in chill that renders stories of ghostly encounters such a goosebumping experience. Perhaps it is the enticing element of things lesser known that haunted places draw a lot of crowd in spite of their ghastly reputation. The land of ancientries and myths, India is home to a host of places that inhibit spirits in their every encompassment. And not just in abandonment, India is home to places that are ghostly even in their reinstated clamour. Here are the top most haunted places in India you wouldn’t dare venture to if you are not particularly a braveheart-</p>
<h3><strong>1- Bhangarh Fort, Rajasthan</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Renowned as the most haunted fort in India.</li>
<li>Legend tells of a magician&#8217;s curse after his love for a princess was rejected.</li>
<li>The entire town remains abandoned and desolate.</li>
<li>Visitors are warned not to enter after sunset.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9519" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bhangarh-Fort-Rajasthan.jpg" alt="Bhangarh Fort, Rajasthan" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bhangarh-Fort-Rajasthan.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bhangarh-Fort-Rajasthan-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bhangarh-Fort-Rajasthan-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>When it comes to haunted places in India, the name most frequently uttered is <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/rajasthan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rajasthan’s</a> Bhangarh Fort. In fact it isn’t just the fort but the entire town of Bhangarh that is undeniably rampant in the spooky feels. It is believed that a magician once fell in love with princess of Bhangarh and wanted to employ black magic to woo her. But the princess got to know about the scheme of things and had her lover killed. Before his death, the forlorn lover cursed the town to remain deserted thus resulting in the present day uninhabited town. Even when the destination is promoted as one of tourist attraction, people are warned against visiting the area after sunset.</p>
<h3><strong>2- Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Famous film studio known for its grand sets and productions.</li>
<li>Staff report unexplained phenomena like falling lights and ghostly encounters.</li>
<li>Considered haunted by spirits of past film crew members.</li>
<li>Combines cinematic magic with chilling stories.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9441" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ramoji-Film-City.jpg" alt="Ramoji Film City" width="900" height="547" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ramoji-Film-City.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ramoji-Film-City-300x182.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ramoji-Film-City-768x467.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Hyderabad’s famous Ramoji Film City might be known for the larger than life extravagance it lends to stories on the silver screen but the ghostly encounters it houses in its confines is equally well known. From spotlights falling on their own to men being pushed and women’s clothes being torn off, eerie encounters run rampant among people who have experienced the ghastly occurrences in Ramoji first hand.</p>

</ul>
<h3><strong>3- Dumas Beach, Gujarat</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Known for its black sand and burial ground history.</li>
<li>Visitors hear mysterious voices and experience strange disappearances.</li>
<li>Labeled one of India’s most haunted beaches.</li>
<li>Caution is advised after dusk due to its eerie reputation.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9522" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dumas-Beach-Gujarat.jpg" alt="Dumas Beach, Gujarat" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dumas-Beach-Gujarat.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dumas-Beach-Gujarat-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dumas-Beach-Gujarat-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>A black sand beach along the Arabian Sea in <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/gujarat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gujarat</a>, the Dumas Beach is counted as one of the most haunted places in India. From voices and laughs without any definitive source of origin to people disappearing inexplicably, paranormal activities on the beach are more than frequent. Be it the isolated location of the beach or it being the site of a burial ground earlier, the Dumas beach is known for its many mystical occurrences. Tourists abound this otherwise beautiful place inspite of the associated ghastliness though all take care to not venture into the mystical sands of the beach after dusk.</p>
<h3><strong>4- Jatinga, Assam</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Site of mysterious mass bird suicides, particularly on moonless nights.</li>
<li>No scientific explanation for the phenomenon exists.</li>
<li>The air of mystery attracts paranormal enthusiasts.</li>
<li>Believed to be haunted due to the unexplained occurrences.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9525" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jatinga-Assam.jpg" alt="Jatinga, Assam" width="900" height="534" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jatinga-Assam.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jatinga-Assam-300x178.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jatinga-Assam-768x456.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>We aren’t quite sure if Jatinga is haunted but the place sure has an air of mystery about it. Every year hundreds of migratory birds commit mass suicide in this place in <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/assam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assam</a>, mainly on moonless nights. And because there hasn’t been any scientific explanation attributable to this eerie phenomena, the inclination to believe that it is indeed a haunted place stands nonetheless.</p>
<h3><strong>5- Khooni Nadi,  Gaya Bihar</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Translates to &#8220;Bloody River,&#8221; infamous for disappearances.</li>
<li>Locals believe touching its waters leads to vanishing.</li>
<li>Dubbed the Bermuda Triangle of  Gaya Bihar.</li>
<li>Surrounded by chilling tales and dark legends.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9528" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Khooni-Nadi- Gaya Bihar.jpg" alt="Khooni Nadi,  Gaya Bihar" width="800" height="414" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Khooni-Nadi- Gaya Bihar.jpg 800w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Khooni-Nadi- Gaya Bihar-300x155.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Khooni-Nadi- Gaya Bihar-768x397.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>With a name like this, we don’t really need any instance to believe in the spooky nature of this <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/ Gaya Bihar-tourist-places-to-visit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spot in  Gaya Bihar</a>. This little stream in  Gaya Bihar’s Rohini area is believed to suck in anyone who dares as much as to touch its jinxed waters! Because of its rampant cases of disappearing humans, this place is also famed as the Bermuda Triangle of  Gaya Bihar.</p>
<h3><strong>6- Fernhill Hotel, Ooty</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Abandoned hotel linked to the Bollywood film &#8220;Raaz.&#8221;</li>
<li>Reports of eerie experiences from film crews working there.</li>
<li>Rumored to be haunted, particularly on its non-existent first floor.</li>
<li>An iconic site for ghost hunters and thrill-seekers.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5187" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Fernhills-Palace-ooty.jpg" alt="Fernhills-Palace-ooty" width="700" height="420" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Fernhills-Palace-ooty.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Fernhills-Palace-ooty-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Fernhills-Palace-ooty-170x102.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Fernhills-Palace-ooty-370x222.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Ooty’s famous Fernhill hotel is the place where one of Bollywood’s finest horror flick Raaz was filmed. And it isn’t just the film where the hotel happens to be the abode of paranormal activities. Even in reality, Fernhill is as haunted a location as any of the other ghostly places in India. The hotel is closed down now but the film crew had really harrowing experiences reportedly coming from the first floor of the hotel which however did not have a first floor!</p>
<h3><strong>7- Shaniwar Wada Fort, Pune</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Historical fort known for ghost sightings during full moons.</li>
<li>Eerie occurrences are reported by visitors.</li>
<li>Associated with tragic tales from its past.</li>
<li>Adds a haunting atmosphere to Pune’s rich history.</li>

<p>Pune’s Shaniwar Wada Fort is one of those places that is the elusive kind. Eerie occurrences are a common phenomenon in the fort every full moon night without any definitive reason as to why such incidents are a recurring event.</p>
<h3><strong>8- Tunnel 33, Shimla</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Also known as Barog Tunnel, named after a tragic engineer.</li>
<li>Believed to be haunted by Colonel Barog’s spirit.</li>
<li>Witnesses report feelings of unease and ghostly encounters.</li>
<li>Features a mix of local lore and chilling history.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9531" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Tunnel-33-Shimla.jpg" alt="Tunnel 33, Shimla" width="900" height="498" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Tunnel-33-Shimla.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Tunnel-33-Shimla-300x166.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Tunnel-33-Shimla-768x425.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The longest tunnel on the Kalka Shimla rail route and in fact one that sits pretty in a seemingly mysterious locale is the Barog Tunnel or the Tunnel No. 33 which is believed to harbour considerable paranormal presence.</p>
<p>The story goes that British engineer Colonel Barog who was entrusted with the task of constructing the tunnel fell prey to a serious miscalculation of the necessary alignment for which he was humiliated in front of his workers. This fall into disgrace was too much to bear for the officer who committed suicide while going on a stroll along the tunnel. Dead and buried in the tunnel vicinity might have led the Colonel’s ghost to famously haunt the place as local beliefs and ‘feels’ have established.</p>
<p>Many people have indeed felt the presence of Mr Barog inside his namesake tunnel. Wandering in and about the station and the tunnel, Barog’s spirit seems to be inspiring eeriness in what is the straightest tunnel in the world. But in spite of famously haunting the route, Mr Barog is seen as a friendly ghost, who is even up for talks and laughs with the people!</p>
<p>But not just Mr Barog can claim the fame for the tunnel which in fact was constructed by another engineer who came after him. Local lores has it that there is another man who goes about the tunnel asking matchsticks to light his cigarette and even a woman who go screaming in and just vanishes into thin air from there! We don’t know how much petrifying this sounds but the dampness of the abandoned tunnel of premise sure holds something sinister at play.</p>
<h3><strong>9- Taj Mahal Hotel, Mumbai</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Iconic hotel linked to the 26/11 terror attacks.</li>
<li>Said to be haunted by the spirit of its chief architect, W.A. Chambers.</li>
<li>Staff have reported strange sightings and experiences.</li>

</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9530" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Taj-Mahal-Hotel-Mumbai.jpg" alt="Taj Mahal Hotel, Mumbai" width="900" height="586" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Taj-Mahal-Hotel-Mumbai.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Taj-Mahal-Hotel-Mumbai-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Taj-Mahal-Hotel-Mumbai-768x500.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Mumbai’s Taj Hotel is famous for its placing in the deadly 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks but there is more to its legacy than just the history and the grand architecture. The hotel is supposed to be haunted by the ghost of its chief architect W.A. Chambers who jumped from the 5th floor of the hotel to his death. The ghost of Chambers reportedly does the rounds along the hotel’s corridors even as the staff reports numerous strange sightings and utterances.</p>
<h3><strong>10- Bombay High Court</strong></h3>
<ul>

<li>Rumored to be haunted by a bilingual lawyer&#8217;s spirit.</li>

</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9520" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bombay-High-Court.jpg" alt="Bombay High Court" width="900" height="562" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bombay-High-Court.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bombay-High-Court-300x187.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bombay-High-Court-768x480.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The high court in Mumbai is supposedly haunted by the spirit of a bilingual lawyer or murder convict for more than three decades now.

<p>Darjeeling’s misty Dow Hills is a quiet place, exactly the kind supposed to be nestling apparitions. The Dow Hill Boarding School for Girls is the hotspot for spirited happenings while the surrounding forest also remains equally embedded in the mystic aura of the unknown. Sightings of a headless boy attributed to numerous murders have been reported by many woodsmen who go into the forest.</p>

<p>Once a bustling fishing hamlet driven to desolateness by the destructive 2004 tsunami waves, Karikattu Kuppam ceases to exist in spirit now. This place in Tamil Nadu is now haunted by the souls of people who unexpectedly lost their lives in the tremendous tragedy. Among the most sighted apparitions are those of an old man and a child that manifest largely in this widely haunted place.</p>

<p>From Mumbai’s posh Malabar Hills area towers the majestic Grand Paradi Towers that are a very telltale sign of affluent living. However not everything about this Uber luxurious building is as bright and gleamy at it appears to be. The towers have been witness to numerous suicides which are attributed to the presence and perpetuation of supernatural spirits within its confines. Ghostly vibes run dominantly within the luxurious nestling which has even led to many of the flats been abandoned.</p>

<p>An international airport hustling and bustling with activity might not sound like the usual suspects that houses spirits and apparitions in its midst. But Bangalore’s Kempegowda airport does not dwell on its business to entertain incidents of a lady in a white saree spotted by most of the staff. Perhaps the most haunted functional airport in the world, Kempegowda stories also talk about a headless ghost roaming somewhere in and around the airport.</p>

<h2>History and Mythology</h2>
<p>Kartik Swami Temple is dedicated to Lord Kartikeya, also known as Kartik Murugan Swami in South India. The temple is believed to be the only one of its kind in Uttarakhand dedicated to this deity. According to Hindu mythology, the temple is located at the spot where Lord Kartikeya offered his bones as a testimony of his devotion to Lord Shiva.</p>
<p>The most popular myth associated with Kartikeya is from the Skanda Purana. Once, Lord Shiva challenged his two sons, Kartikeya and Ganesha, to a race around the universe. The winner would earn the right to be worshipped first. Kartikeya set off on his journey around the universe, while Ganesha, in his wisdom, circled around his father, claiming that he was the universe. Pleased with Ganesha&#8217;s intelligence, Lord Shiva awarded him the privilege of being worshipped first, leading to Kartikeya&#8217;s anger and subsequent sacrifice of his flesh and bones in reverence to his father. It is said that the bones of Lord Kartikeya are worshipped in this temple.</p>
