										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A tiny tucked away in Kinnaur, Himachal Pradesh, on the border with Tibet; Nako is a little known surprise. Home to the Nako Lake, the mystical holy lake that looks most resplendent early in the morning, Nako is delighting as you discover it layer by layer. Still steeped in the medieval aura, it is rich in traditions and it shows in the calmness that engulfs you as soon as you enter the place. Step into paradise and feel blissfully alive by being one with nature as it frames a man-made display.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-5492 alignright" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nako-Lake.jpg" alt="Nako-Lake" width="300" height="187" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nako-Lake.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nako-Lake-170x106.jpg 170w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Before Malling Nullah, between Kinnaur and Spiti, it piques everyoneâ€™s interest for it is a land where time has stood still. Flanked by the Himalayas on three sides, Nako is worth getting the Inner Line Permit required to enter this restricted area. The permit can be easily obtained from Reckong Peo or from Kaza and Shimla. It is your passport of uninterrupted peace, quiet and a rejuvenating holiday like no other.</p>
<p>Walk around the village and admire the crystal clear water of the snow and glacier-fed lake. On clear days you can catch the reflection of the entire village and mountains around it floating on it surface. During winters, it freezes over, making it any photographerâ€™s dream come true.</p>
<p>There are many monasteries in and around Nako, making it the perfect trekking point. The new monastery has exquisite wall paintings with a small collection of Buddhist books, statues and also a Tibetan Drum.</p>
<p>Nako has a very Tibetan character. Deodum is the local village deity and a Lagang temple with many idols is also present here. The Nako monastery was founded by Rinchen Zangpo. It has seven temples in all, with some of the older ones having exceptional frescoes and scriptures. A Tibetan form of Buddhism is still alive in these areas and the Monasteries are a standing testament of the communityâ€™s religious beliefs and history. The structures are now endangered due to rain and water originating from snow melts. The most important temples are the Lhakhang Gongma (Upper Temple) and the Lotsawa Lhakhang (Translatorâ€™s Temple) and restoration and conservation work here has already been started.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-5493 alignright" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nako-Village.jpg" alt="Nako-Village" width="300" height="192" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nako-Village.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nako-Village-170x110.jpg 170w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />The streets and houses are lined with red, green, yellow and blue prayer flags. The houses have stone fences and are themselves made of rubble with flat roofs are painted white. Inside, the doors have beautiful Tibetan wall paintings. The people here are not used to many tourists and expect respect for their culture. Always walk clock-wise around temples and chortles, with your right side facing them. Even touching them with your left hand is not appreciated. The mandalas are painted in Kashmiri influenced Indo-Tibetan style.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The best time to visit is June-October and the lake is open for boating. In the winters the lake is just perfect for ice skating. Enjoy the local fare at the few Dhabas. Relish the Momos, noodles and even, Dal-Chawal. Nako is 110 km from Sangla and 60 Km from Tabo. House to the footprints of Saint Padmasambhava&#8217;s, it has rightfully earned the title of â€˜Gateway to Buddhist Pilgrimageâ€™.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Narkanda owes its initial importance to the construction of the Hindustan Tibet Road. Originally styled â€˜The Great Hindustan Tibet Roadâ€™, this road connected the Gangetic plains from the town of Kalka to the Tibetan border. It was Governor-General of India, Lord Dalhousie (1848-1856) who ordered work to begin on this in June 1850. Various reasons are cited for the initiation of the road. The system of â€˜begariâ€™ prevalent in the hills, where unpaid laborers were pressed into service â€“ including for the transport of timber and files to Shimla â€“ is said to have upset the Governor-General so deeply that he wanted to improve the track these men trudged. It is also believed that Lord Dalhousie wanted to create trade ties with Tibet â€“ and this felt to be the real reason for building the road.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5879" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Snowfall-near-Narkanda.jpg" alt="Snowfall-near-Narkanda" width="996" height="666" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Snowfall-near-Narkanda.jpg 996w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Snowfall-near-Narkanda-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Snowfall-near-Narkanda-768x514.jpg 768w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Snowfall-near-Narkanda-165x110.jpg 165w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Snowfall-near-Narkanda-370x247.jpg 370w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Snowfall-near-Narkanda-780x522.jpg 780w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" /><br />
Narkanda was an important staging post on this road and was the highest point between Shimla and the valley of the river Satluj. From this point on, till it began rising again for the final leg, the road was largely downhill.Â  The second impetus of growth came in the first half of the twentieth century, when apple product began in Kotgarh-Thanedar belt a few kilometers from Narkanda.</p>
<p>The peak of Hatu (Hattu), above Narkanda, is amongst the highest in the mid-Himalaya. These heights mark the line before the hillside moves down to the valley of the Satluj River. The peak can be accessed by a narrow motorable road from Narkanda which is functional during the summer months. Alternatively, there is an 8 kilometer hike trail that passes through dense woods of cedar, spruce and oak; if you are a good walker, this is a far better option as it will unfold vistas that remain screened by windshields. The view from Hatu is absolutely breathtaking. Below lies the river valley and the hillside that reaches down, is covered with thick forests, little villages, apple orchards and terraced fields. Across, is the magnificent spread of the greater Himalaya with a permanent cover of snow; the Kinner Kailash (one of the legendary abodes of Lord Shiva), the Shrikhand and the Kullu ranges are all clearly visible from here. The temple of Hateshwari Mata of Hatu Peak is dedicated to a local embodiment of Devi Durga.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6239" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hatu-peak.jpg" alt="hatu-peak" width="700" height="437" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hatu-peak.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hatu-peak-300x187.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hatu-peak-170x106.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hatu-peak-370x231.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
From Narkanda one can visit Thanedar and Kotgarh. Harmony Hall at Thanedar is not exactly what one would expect to find in a little village in the Himalaya, howsoever prosperous. It stands on top of a hill, surrounded by apple orchards. It is an unusual piece of architecture that draws from the local style of interlocking horizontal wooden beams packed with dressed stone, and is combined with elements of the â€˜westernâ€™ architectural experience â€“ high chimney-stacks and large windows. It also speaks worlds for Satyanand Stokes, the man who built it â€“ a man who came from an entirely different background and made this house in what was then a â€˜back-of-the-beyondâ€™ in the hills. Stokes left an indelible mark on the lives of the people with whome he lived. The contiguous settlements of Thanedar and Kotgarh form the core of Himachalâ€™s appleâ€“growing heartland. This pocket of charming mountain countryside is also reputed to have amongst the highest per capita incomes in South-east Asia. And all this prosperity is due to stokes, who introduced the American varieties of apple in the area and modern systems of marketing and packing. Apples apart, soon after the repressive Rowlatt Acts were passed in 1919, stokes became an active associate of Mahatma Gandhi and was even jailed for his role in Indiaâ€™s struggle for freedom.</p>
<p>The collection of some half a dozen large and small villages that lie below Thanedar â€“ and named after the main hamlet â€“ give the name to the area below, â€˜The Kotgarh Valley.â€™</p>
<p>The setting of Kotgarh predates stokes and this was a tract where many fled to escape from local oppressors. Then some two centuries ago, during the â€˜Gurkha Warsâ€™ that the British first came to this area. The little wooden church of St. Mary at Kotgarh predates the apples. A school was established here in 1843 and the church built in 1872; this was run by the Moravian missionaries and the Church Missionary Society. While this may be what more recent times have given the area, apart from the forests and magnificent views that hold the deep valley and the snow-ranges, nature has given Kotgarh a small lake, Tani Jubbar and by its side is a small temple built of wood and slate. This is the site of a local fair held at the end of May.<br />

Substantially populated by Brahmins, the village of Nirmand lies across the valley of the river Satluj and is the largest village in Himachal. The word â€˜Nirmandâ€™ is regarded as a derivative of â€˜Nir â€“ mundâ€™, or without a head and is closely connected with the legend of Parashurama, who is regarded as the sixth incarnation of Lord Vishnu â€“ and is the one just before Ram. Parashurama was one of the ten sons of the sage Jamadagni and his wife Renuka. One day the sage was beset with doubts about his wifeâ€™s fidelity and commanded Parashurama to kill her. Nirmand has also been a major centre of the â€˜bhundaâ€™, human sacrifices as it once existed in the hills.</p>
<p>From the banks of the Satluj, the road to Nirmand rises in zigzag snips. The first section is through bare rock and scraggy bushes. These weaves of tarmac hold the training camp of one the few mountain batteries that still uses pack animals. One of the oldest records from the hills of Himachal comes in the shape of what is called the â€˜Nirmand Copper Plateâ€™. This plate records a land grant dated to the seventh century.</p>
<p>Narrow streets wind their way through the few acres that form the core of this village that may well have been inhabited for a millennium and a half. The path to the Kothi of Parashurama slices through the heart of the village. En route lies the sacred â€˜Latta Baoliâ€™ whee clear spring water gushes into a small tank. Then is the tiny â€“ but remarkably elegant â€“ temple of Shiva that is barely the height of a child but has perfectly classical proportions. The temple of Parashurama has a pent-roof and age-old lines of wood and intricate carvings make its faÃ§ade. Here lies the mythical axes of Parashurama and several other items of dress and armour that are attributed to him â€“ and are only take out their cave at the time of a bhunda â€“ which is still held as ritual every few years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Location:</strong> Solan District, Himachal Pradesh<br />
<strong>Altitude:</strong> 6100 feet<br />
<strong>Best Time to Visit:</strong> April to October</p>
<p>Kasauli is a solitary settlement on a hilltop, in Solan district of Himachal Pradesh. It is located about 320 kilometers away from New  Gaya Bihar. The landscape, climate and the terrain of Kasauli are completely different from other hill stations in North India. And, being located is one of the young Himalayan Mountains; Kasauli is very rich in flora and fauna. The name Kasauli is derived from a flower called Kasool, which grows in this region. The town is most commonly known for its lush foliage, quietness and its cobbled passages.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6288" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Kasauli.jpg" alt="Kasauli" width="800" height="500" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Kasauli.jpg 800w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Kasauli-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Kasauli-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Kasauli-170x106.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Kasauli-370x231.jpg 370w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Kasauli-780x488.jpg 780w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><br />
The extremely neat town is situated 6100 ft above the sea level. The region is suitable for vegetation such as Himalayan Oak, Chir-Pine and Horse Chestnut trees to grow in abundance. The town also exhibits an exceptional concoction of British Victorian age, the Indian Medieval Period and the Modern Indian. Every year, this small town receives a huge number of tourists, especially weekend travelers from the neighbouring cities.</p>
<p>In the 17th century, Kasauli was home for the Rajput families, but it was taken over by the Britishers in the 19th century. Thus, besides Shimla, Kasauli became a summer destination for the British generals and the soldiers. Today, Kasauli is not only a tourist destination, but it is a large military cantonment.</p>
<p>This town is slightly on the upper-range (Expensive), thus most backpackers usually avoid going to Kasauli â€“ room for one night starts from Rs.1000. In Kasauli, resorts outnumber hotels and guesthouses; resorts at the upper mall road provide the best view in the whole town. Vacationers love walking on foot to explore the town, but the picturesque Kasauli surroundings can also be explored on rented motorbikes and taxies.</p>
<p>What can you do in Kasauli? Very simple! Take a few good books with you and drink a lot of Tea! But if you have plans to explore the town, make sure to carry an umbrella or a rain jacket; the weather in Kasauli can be very unpredictable.</p>
<h3><strong>Places to Visit in Kasauli</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Sunset Points</strong><br />
The first and foremost destination is the sunset point. This spot is located approximately 1.2 km away from the Kasauli club House (The Upper Mall Road) or 2.5 km from the bus stand. Walking on this particular stretch is very pleasant! In a way, sunset point and monkey point offers the same view, except that, for security reasons tourists are not allowed to visit the monkey point after 5:30 P.M. The sunset view is simply wonderful; the entire scene looks like an artwork on a huge wall. Cuddle up, take pictures; snug-in, the choice is yours, but make sure you visit this place. The best time to visit sunset point is between 6:30 P.M and 7:30 P.M. (depending on the season). After the sun sets in, for a change, the sky and the earth resembles each other. They look equally beautiful; the sky is full of stars, scattered everywhere and the same on earth as people living in the low-lying area turn on the light. Note; they do not allow visitors to go beyond the Air Force check point (Which is 1 km before the sunset point) after 7:30 P.M., so make sure you are already inside!</p>
<p><strong>Monkey Point</strong><br />
Itâ€™s also the highest elevation point in Kasauli, where a temple is erected in honor of Lord Hanuman (the Hindu Monkey King according to Hindu mythology). Itâ€™s a pleasant walk to the monkey point, which is around 5 km from the main town. Once inside the premises, one has to climb around 0â€™8 km to reach the temple. Otherwise there is a restaurant inside the premises with severs excellent tea and after a good view of the Punjab plains. All sorts of electronic devices, including phones, cameras, pen drives, music player etc are strictly not allowed inside the premises. Make sure you donâ€™t carry them with you, unless you travel by car where you can deposit them safely â€“ also carry your passport or an identity Card with you. On a clear day, one can see the plains of Chandigarh, the terrain of Punjab, the hills around Shimla and the silver lining of Satluj River.</p>
<p><strong>Sunrise Point</strong><br />
There are few sunrise points in Kasauli, the most prominent being one on the way to monkey point and the other on the way to sunset point. For early birds, this is the perfect destination. Most travelers say; a Trip to Kasauli is incomplete if you fail to witness the sun rise â€“ the crimson sun slowly emerges, the world becomes brighter and brighter, it looks like the sun will never stop growing in size.</p>
<p><strong>The Markets</strong><br />
Kasauli has two markets adjoining to each other, Pine Mall and Heritage Mall â€“ stretches around 150 meters. They are very small markets, but sell cute and fancy items such as handicraft, accessories and women clothes. Also, there are small eating joints, which sell Maggie, Thukpa, Momo etc. but if you want something different, visit Rudar CafÃ© â€“ the cafÃ© was opened by few boys, a year ago. They play nice music throughout the day, and the food is great too!</p>
<p><strong>Christ Church</strong><br />
The Christ Church is nothing fancy, but quite attractive! It was built in 1844 and located right next to Kasauli bus stand. It was built in the style of Anglican churches â€“ the lustful shrubbery and trees around add to the beauty of the church. On a regular day, this church is flooded by tourist taking pictures and walking around it.</p>
<p>Strolling through the narrow thoroughfares and bird watching are very common activities among holiday makers. Above all, the best thing to do in Kasauli is to simply stroll or pick a conversation with some stranger over a cup of tea. Remember they are also travelers like us and are looking to engage in some adventurous activities! One cannot get loud on the street; itâ€™s a cantonment area. Smoking is strictly prohibited in public places; penalty can go upto Rs.25000. besides, itâ€™s best to make hotel reservation before arriving at Kasauli.</p>
<h4><strong>How to Get There</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Roadway:</strong> buses, coaches and taxis are easily available from  Gaya Bihar<br />
<strong>Nearest Railway Station:</strong> Kalka in Haryana (40 km from Kasauli)<br />
<strong>Nearest Airport:</strong> Shimla airport and Chandigarh airport (35km and 65km from Kasauli)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Himachal Pradesh is full of incredible destinations and offers diverse sceneries to its visitors. While navigating through the splendid landscape of Spiti Valley, I stumbled at the picturesque hamlet of Langa.</p>
<p>Spiti Valley is full of isolated villages blessed with ancient monasteries and remains of prehistoric life but there are few villages those will awe-struck its visitors and leave them speechless wandering about the magic of nature. Langza is certainly one of those!<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3248" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Langza.jpg" alt="Langza" width="741" height="486" /><br />
Set amidst the green pastures surrounded by snow-clad mountain, the village of Langza is primarily dominated by the statue of Lord Buddha overlooking the valley and an ancient monastery. Langza village situated at an altitude of 4400 meters is divided into 2 sections, namely Langza Yongma (Lower) and Langza Gongma (upper). This homogeneous Buddhist village belongs to the Sakyapa sect of Tibetan Buddhism. Langza house a population of 137 in 33 households. The mainstay of this village in the olden days was mud craft. Vessels of all shapes and sizes were produced here and supplied to the entire valley for household use. This craft has dwindled over the ages and the current mainstay is primarily to agriculture, the village is adorned by an ancient Lang (Temple) estimated to be around 1000 years old. The Lang is regarded as the headquarters of all the Devtas (deities) of the Spiti Valley.</p>
<p>Life is not always blossoming in such a hostile terrain. Summers are the salubrious season for marking and gazing the sheep. Winters are long and inclement at Langza. Langza remain disconnected from the civilization during winters; only a few brave souls stay in their mud house during that inhospitable weather. As summers arrive, the transformation of snow fields to green pastures is truly overwhelming and Langza opens its door for few fortunate visitors.</p>
<p>Other than visiting the monastery and mud houses of the village, travellers can also take the trail to few high altitude lakes and even try to accomplish any peak around Langza. Fossils of Marine animals which are found in the vicinity of Langza village lure many geologists and anthropologists each year. I enjoyed the absolute solitude of strolling around Langza village which is very rich with fossils of Marine animals and plants those were here millions of years ago and it presented me a glimpse of the prehistoric era when Spiti was submerged in the Tethys Sea. Though I spent significant time at Langza but I left it with frowning curiosity of missing something. Those dotted mud shelters in the middle of wide pasture of silent colors still in my dreams and temple me!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The quaint little town of Bharmour is held in high regard for it is the pious earth of this place that houses the Chaurasi Temple. It is, in fact, a complex housing many temples with the Lakshmi Devi, Ganesh, Manimahesh and Narasimha being the main ones. It is around these temples that the activities, culture and customs of the people of the area revolve. The splendid mountains all around embrace it in their folds and add majesty to an already devout atmosphere. It is also known as the Chaurasi Khamba for the exquisite 84 pillars that form a part of the temple complex. Ring the bells that resonate through tranquillity with NamasteIndiaTrip.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3245" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chaurasi-Temple-Bharmour.jpg" alt="Chaurasi Temple Bharmour" width="741" height="486" /><br />
The story goes back many hundred years when the place was known as Brahmpura and the Goddess Brahmani Devi lived here. Once when she was away for a while, Shiva came here with 84 Yogis or Siddhas (Saints) on his way to Manimahesh Kailash. Seeing the smoke billowing from the fires lit by the saints, Brahmani Devi, on here return, got very furious and asked them to leave. Shiva asked to be allowed to stay for a night and assured that they would leave in the morning. The next day, Shiva left Kailash alone, leaving the saints there. Unwilling to leave the place, they transformed themselves into 84 Shivlings. Brahmani Devi was blessed by Shiva and he ruled that everyone undertaking the Kailash pilgrimage must take a dip in the holy Brahmani Pool before continuing their journey or else, their pilgrimage would be fruitless. Brahmani pool is below the Brahmani Cave and it is said that she stole the water from Sandholi Naag on the other side of the ridge for this pool. The legend regarding how she came to be a goddess is equally interesting. It is said that Brahmani lived in a Vatika on tall ridge and her son was very fond of a Chitkor (a kind of bird). The Chitkor was killed by a farmer and her son could not bear the loss and died. Heart-broken she buried herself alive and the spirits of al three of them started haunting the locals.</p>
<p>Another fable regarding the temple is that of King Sahil Varman who ruled during the tenth century. 84 Saints came to his kingdom and pleased by his welcome and hospitality, granted him the boon of ten sons and a daughter. The town of Chamba is said to have been named so after his daughter. The town of Chamba is said to have been named so after his daughter, Champavati. The temple also holds importance for being the abode of the Pandavas during their 14 years of exile.</p>
<p>A Ganesha temple stands near the entrance of the complex. The tallest temple in that of Manimahesh and has been built in the Shikhara style. The most ornate and based on the old wooden style temples is the Lakshana Devi Temple.</p>
<p>The best time to take a trip to Chaurasi Temple is from May to November as it gets bitterly cold and snowed-in during winters. Devotees visit it during their trip to Manimahesh Kailash and the pilgrimage takes place during this period. There is no dearth of places to stay in Bharmour and reaching the temple is also relatively easy, given that the place is well connected 65 km from Chamba, there are many special buses that ply on this route. It is well connected by railways also, with the nearest broad gauge and narrow gauge stations at Pathankot and Kangra respectively. When so many Gods dwell together, it becomes all the more compelling to pay a visit and cast away all sins.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The temples at Lakshana Devi and Ganesha are the oldest in the complex.</li>
<li>There is a spellbinding brass idol of Lakshana Devi in her Mahishasura Mardini avatar.</li>
<li>The water of Ardh-Ganga or Gupt Ganga, a water source in a corner of the complex has religious significance.</li>
<li>Bharmour is also referred to as Shiv Bhoomi.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a leisurely trip to unwind amidst nature at its best or to experience the thrill of adventure sports or even experience the traditions and customs of the locals, Himachal is the perfect getaway. There is a special and unique setting where nature co-exists with the man-made, striking a perfect balance, each helping the other. Be a part of this experience and observe it from close quarters, enriching and entertaining yourself in the process.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-938" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Kufari-Himachal.png" alt="Kufari, Himachal" width="700" height="400" /><br />
<strong>Exquisite Wildlife</strong><br />
Treat yourself to the splendour of wildlife. The many wildlife sanctuaries and national parks amaze you to rare and exotic birds, animals, flowers, trees and an amazing array of fish that interest travellers from around the world. Take a trip to the Great Himalayan National Park, the Pin Valley National Park, the Gobind Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary, the Kalatop Khajjiar Sanctuary and many more for a glimpse of the ibex, the snow leopard and the Monal and absorb the beauty that surrounds you.</p>
<p>Arm yourself with a pair of binoculars and go on a visual hunt for a variety of birds that traverse the Himalayan sky. Birding is a popular activity that has arrested and sparked the imagination of writers and painters alike. You donâ€™t have to be one to enjoy the birdsâ€™ everyday chirping, as they go about their routine. It will be hours before you realize that time has passed as you enjoyed a peak into their enchanted lives. Head to Kasauli, Narkanda, Sangla, Sarahan, Nako, Kaza or Shoja for views of birds weaving nests to feeding their young ones, the birds keep you mesmerized with their antics. Enjoy from the various vantage bird-watching points located all over Himachal and feast your eyes on Fly-catchers, Western Tragopans, Humming Birds, Magpies and the many more.</p>
<p>Himachal showcases it wildlife in its natural settings. At the many national parks and sanctuaries, a leopard that springs out from behind a rock, or preys in the wild or sips water along a stream is anytime worth spending more time on than one that is securely locked away. Try keeping your eyes on a deer as it runs to and fro or follow the fish as they swim in crystal clear waters.</p>
<p>Travel along the umpteen nature trails and hikes to enter the heart of Himachal. Choose from the Beas Kund trek, the Triund Ridge-Laka Glacier trek, Bir Billing trek, Roop Kund Trek, Manali Hampta Pass herb trek, the Kinnar Kailash Trek etc. a seemingly inconspicuous opening into the wilderness opens up a world that is enigmatic and full of life. Wander off any road and be ready to be surprised by the twists and turns that lead to off-beat marvels. Aromatic herbs, colourful flowers and delicate ferns vie for space among the trees. There are special trails where you can pick strawberries or learn about the local flora. Trek to valleys that are in full bloom or waterfalls that call for memorable pictures. Follow the historical trails to Malana village (Kullu) or to the heritage village of Paragpur (Kangra). Discover the way of life of people in these regions and the architecture from olden days. Hike along ridges and scale slopes that will test your endurance and impress the enormity of nature upon you. There are treks that are suitable for cycling as well and can enable you to cover more distances and experience more of the wonderful landscapes.</p>
<p>The best part of these activities is that they bring you closer to nature while maintaining its sanctity. These activities do not involve any destruction of nature and are in fact aimed at sensitizing tourists towards the importance of a balanced eco-system in our lives.</p>
<p><strong>Adventure Galore</strong><br />
There are as many adventure sports in Himachal as there are interests of tourists. There is always a perfect activity for your level of expertise, time and interest. From skiing and paragliding to angling to hot air ballooning, take your pick and be ready for an adventure filled ride like nowhere else.</p>
<p>If being on land is not adventurous enough for you, try your hand at paragliding. At Solang valley, Bundla Dhar and Bir-Billing, fly like a bird by opting for paragliding. Bir-Billing is a premium place for paragliding, at par with the best around the world. Ride the air currents and learn to steer your way through fresh Himachal air.</p>
<p>With a permit you can fish for freshwater fish in the rivers of Himachal. It does not affect the fish population adversely as it is regulated and you are not allowed to fish blindly. Angle for Trout and Mahaseer by the Beas, Giri, Yamuna or at the Maharana Pratap Sagar and the Gobind Sagar reservoirs. Nothing beat the idle soaking in the sun by the river side with friends and marine life for company.</p>
<p><strong>Lose Yourself in Local Customs and Traditions</strong><br />
Ever imagined what it would be like to live life the Himachali way? Take advantage of the Home Stay scheme launched by the government and stay with a Himachal family. Many local families have opened up their homes and their hearts for tourists to introduce them to their lifestyle and give them a taste of their hospitality. Feel the warmth of a house built of clay, bricks and slate and get a chance to examine Himachali architecture closely.</p>
<p>Match your steps with the locals to the rhythm of Dangi, Burah Nati and shunto dances. The reverberating beats of instruments accompanying the dances and the haunting songs are enough to get any one ready to dance. Wrap around a Kullu shawl in vibrant colours and beat the chilliest of winter days. Shop for silver jewellery and bamboo articles and take back memories that adorn your life. The rustic and colourful Chamba Rumal is a wonderful present for friends and a prized possession to brighten up your home. But learning how to embroider one, takes the experience to a whole new level. Doing so not just feels good but is also encouraging for the local artisans who have been earning a livelihood through traditional crafts.</p>
<p><strong>Mystic of Dev Bhoomi</strong><br />
Himachal beckons tourists from India and abroad, of all ages and of varied interests. There are many who <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/himachal-tour-packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Travel to Himachal</strong></a> as it is the quintessential â€˜dev bhoomiâ€™. Religious tourism is another avenue that can be explored here. With people from all walks of life flocking here for divine blessings, it is indeed a popular destination. From Hadimba temple and Manu temple in Manali, the Jakhu temple in Shimla, Naina Devi temple, Jwala ji, Chamunda Devi, Baijnath temple and many more that draw devotees from far and wide. The Paonta Sahib Gurudwara, the Manikaran Gurudwara and the like are also visited by people from around the world. Not only does this act as a catalyst for achievement of spiritual and religious aspirations, it also encourages sharing of folk tales, traditional lore and mystical stories passed down verbally through the generations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Himachal Pradesh, Land of the Gods, An Unforgettable Experience for Tourists</p>
<p>Himachal Pradesh dressed in exotic natural beauty is one of the most preferred hill stations for tourists from every nook and corner of the nation. Shimla, Kulla, Manali, Dharamshala, Dalhousie and many more visiting places in this hilly state nestled in the foothills of the snowcapped peaks attract thousands of tourists every year who are captivated by the magical scenic beauty of this hill station. Find more info on Himachal Pradesh visiting places.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3182" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Dhankar-Lake-in-Himachal-Pradesh.jpg" alt="Dhankar Lake in Himachal Pradesh" width="700" height="382" /><br />
Himachal Pradesh rests serenely in the North West of India, with the Himalayan ranges rising majestically to the skies in the North, Tibet in the East and then the gently rolling lush green pastures of Punjab to the West and South. Himachal has rivers, plains, valleys, mountains, lakes and is blessed with an abundance of flowers, foliage and fruits, a land blessed by the God, the Land of Gods, an unforgettable experience for tourists from any part of the world. If the mountains do not stun you with their glorious majesty, the rolling and frolicking rivers will; if the forests do not entice you the lakes will beckon. A week or a month is just not enough for you to have your fill of this tapestry of natural beauty where snow and grasses mesh with rocks, flowers and woods. Himachal offers unmatched charms in its scenic destinations such as Shimla, Manali, Kufri, Chail, Dalhousie, Kullu, Dharamshala, Kasauli, Kinnaur and Palampur Tiger Reserve. These are by no means the only places. Rajgarh, the lush green valley is just as attractive a destination as Pragpur and the Maharaja Pratap Sagar lake sanctuary leading you on to Kangra Fort.</p>
<p>Himachal offers something for every taste. If you wish to bask in the bucolic charms of rural environs, Himachal invites you to immerse yourself in local culture as yet untouched by modern influences. Visit Pragpur in Kangra, the first heritage village of India along with Rukhala and Naggar. It is a different world altogether.</p>
<p>Himachal has a spiritual side you can explore to the fullest. Buddhists make a beeline for Dharamshala and McLeodganj where time stands still and you can see monks still practicing the same way they used to do since centuries. Hindus can have their fill of temples such as the Hatkoti Temple, the Bajreshwari temple in Kangra, Baijnath temple near Palampur, the Chamunda Devi temple near Dharamshala and Jwalamukhi temple close to Kangra. Then you have the Raghunathji temple in Kullu, the Bijli Mahadev temple in Kullu, Chhatri Temple and Lakshmi Narayan Temple in Chamba, the last being one of the oldest temples in the State dedicated to Vishnu and Shiva. Do not miss Raghunathji temple in Kullu. The Gurudwaras at Manikaran and Rewalsar attract Sikhs. For Buddhists, a visit to the Tabo and Kye monasteries along with Kungri Gompa, Shashur and Kardang monasteries is a must. Christians have a presence here and the Christ Church in Shimla is a landmark with its beautiful stained glass windows, just as beautiful as the St Michaelâ€™s Church with its marble altars and candles lighting up the place in a holy glow. Truly, Himachal is the Land of Gods.</p>
<p>The adventurous can have their fill of action in Himachal. Tourism, especially adventure tourism is highly developed here and you can go skiing in Manali and Kufri. There are hundreds of steep mountain faces you can climb and if you are so inclined, indulge in hang gliding at Bir and Billing. Boating and rafting become perilous, breathtaking and thrilling if you care to dare the boiling waters of Himachalâ€™s rivers. The rivers also offer an opportunity to go fishing.</p>
<p>For those with a taste for wildlife, Himachal Pradesh offers ample opportunities to fulfill your desires. Just lose yourself in the grand vistas of the Great Himalayan National Park or move on to the Pin Valley National Park or to the Maharaja Pratap Sagar Lake. Go on a safari and meet animals and birds face to face, take photographs and come away with some remarkable memories of living life in the great outdoors.</p>
<p>If you go to Himachal, you simply must visit Spiti, close to Ladakh and Tibet, ahead of Manali. This is a unique world, quite unlike anything you will come across anywhere in India.</p>
<p>Then there are the passes. The two most visited and famous passes are the Rohtang and Baralacha with Pin Parvati and Kunzum the other two. Baralacha is on the Manali-Leh Road at a height of 4890 meters, leading you on to Suraj Tal Lake. Rohtang Pass is at height of 3978 meters along the Manali Keylong Road whereas Pin Parvati and Kunzum are in the Spiti district. These two passes lead you to the confluence of Sutlej and Spiti (Pin Parvati) and to the Bara Shigri Glacier, the second largest one in the world. These passes are open only for a few short months during summer so plan your tour accordingly.</p>
<p>If it is scenic beauties of nature that appeal to you, then the first place you will visit is the Baspa Valley in Kinnaur, a veritable Shangri La with its mountains, valleys, forested slopes and rivers. While here take a trip to Sangla and Kalpa villages, quaint and frozen in time. Sangla has the Kamru Fort with a Kamakshi Temple, a much visited place. Kalpa is known for the Kinner Kailash Mountain that changes colors through the day. The dreamy Pin Valley is another place that will enthrall you with its symphony of mountains, Spiti River, quaint villages and the main attractions: snow leopards and Ibex. The Lingti valley is a repository of history where you will find fossils dating back 250 million years. Keylong, above Bhaga River is poetry of greenery and water bodies melding seamlessly with snowcapped mountains and water bodies, a place where you can enjoy nature in all its finery.</p>
<p>There are places where you can find crowds and places where you can find peace and quiet. Some of the off-the-beaten-track places are Khoksar, the coldest place in Lahaul in winter. Rakcham has a charming beauty all its own as people who visit Kinnaur are now discovering. Nako is perched at a height of 3662 and getting there is a feat, quite rewarding, in itself. The breathtaking scenery spread below you is worth the effort. Kibber is another village, one of the highest in the world, an eagleâ€™s eyrie at a height of 4205 meters and from here you can go to Gette, the highest village in the world.</p>
<p>Pack your bags and go: Himachal beckons.</p>
