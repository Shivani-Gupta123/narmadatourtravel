										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The renowned Pink City of <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/rajasthan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rajasthan</a>, <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/jaipur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaipur</a>, dazzles with its vibrant colors and royal heritage. Equally captivating is its diverse culinary scene, where each dish tells a story. From sweet to savory, and spicy to tangy, the flavors of Jaipur create a truly royal palate. Unique, exotic, and utterly irresistible, the culinary experience here is a feast for the senses. Here’s a roundup of the must-try dishes in Jaipur that will enrich your travel tale with unforgettable flavors.</p>
<h3><strong>Dal Bati Churma</strong></h3>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9310" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dal-Bati-Churma.jpeg" alt="Dal Bati Churma" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dal-Bati-Churma.jpeg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dal-Bati-Churma-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dal-Bati-Churma-768x432.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>No matter in which color coded city you land up in while in Rajasthan, you definitely would be only better off digging into the very traditional fare of Dal Bati Churma. One of the most distinctive foods of the many Indian states, this staple of Rajasthan also enjoys equal esteem in Jaipur.</p>
<p>A dish as steeped in tradition as it is in taste, Dal Baati Churma is in fact a diversive meal in its trio encompassment. Wheat flour doughs are shaped like balls and baked in traditional ovens, giving them their charred appearance and characteristic flavour. These Batis are broken and done up with a serving of panchmel dal that is also a nutritious mix, comprising of five types of lentils.</p>
<p>Churma on the other hand is the dessert component of this ‘three course meal’ that is also as interesting a food on its own. Crushed batis are roasted in ghee and then are sweetened with sugar or jaggery and flavored with fragrant spices. There’s nothing that quite matches the taste of smoky baatis savored with some delicious savoury dal and done up with the sweetened churma. Unique, flavorful and popular like no dish else, a taste of Jaipur wouldn’t be the same without this signature classic.</p>

<p><strong>Mawa Kachori</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9322" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Mawa-Kachori.jpg" alt="Mawa Kachori" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Mawa-Kachori.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Mawa-Kachori-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Mawa-Kachori-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Rajasthan already is famous enough for its Kachoris. Not the dry, lentil stuffed ones that we encounter everywhere throughout India. Kachoris of the royal state tend to be as much royal, as they come with a generous filling of an onion mixture. But even in its transgressing way with the Kachori, Pyaaz Kachori would hardly be the most exotic dish ever. That credit should rather go to the more daring and more awe inspiring Mawa Kachori.</p>
<p>Even when a sweet Kachori would be unheard of in other parts of the country, in Jaipur this dainty disc of dripping decadence is a routine delight. A rich preparation that includes mawa as the filling of the Kachori in place of the spicy masala, Mawa Kachoris takes a generous dip in some sensuous sugar syrup making this sticky, sweet treat a real euphoria for the senses.</p>
<p><strong>Keema Baati</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9319" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Keema-Baati.jpg" alt="Keema Baati" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Keema-Baati.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Keema-Baati-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Keema-Baati-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Largely a vegetarian state, Rajasthan throws up quite some pleasant surprises even in its non-veg menu. One such unique food that makes up for among the more famous stuff in Jaipur is Keema Baati. Once again at play in this authentic food is the Baati the state is almost ubiquitous with. But this time around the Baatis come stuffed with minced and spiced mutton meat. Quite a spicy treat in the Keema being mixed with a number of spices, this deep fried or preferably baked, rich and rustic dish allows for a really vibrant explosion of flavours in your mouth.</p>

<p><strong>Jaipuri Aloo Pyaaz ki Sabzi</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9315" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-Aloo-Pyaaz-ki-Sabzi.jpg" alt="Jaipuri Aloo Pyaaz ki Sabzi" width="900" height="576" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-Aloo-Pyaaz-ki-Sabzi.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-Aloo-Pyaaz-ki-Sabzi-300x192.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-Aloo-Pyaaz-ki-Sabzi-768x492.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Despite its grand architecture and princely pink premises, Jaipur remains a royal land steeped in simplicity. Which makes even the most simplest of stuff part of its culinary history. One such very humble preparation that is a famous food in Jaipur is the ubiquitous Jaipuri Aloo Pyaaz ki Sabzi. Ghee fried potatoes and onions are simmered in a spicy buttery tomato gravy to deliver a dish that boasts of a melt in your mouth texture. In its flavorful essence and rich taste, this dish smacks of the royal heritage of Rajasthan even in its simplistic soul.</p>
<p><strong>Ghevar</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9313" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ghevar.jpg" alt="Ghevar" width="900" height="598" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ghevar.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ghevar-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ghevar-768x510.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The Dal Bati Churma of sweets in Rajasthan is the delicately delicious sweetmeat called Ghevar. Tracing its roots to Jaipur, this is one food famous throughout the country for its very different taste and texture. Unlike most other Indian sweets you would have tasted, Ghevar is an immensely rich dessert. The honeycomb like disc-shaped cake made with all-purpose flour and soaked in sugar syrup is a firm favorite, for its delectable goodness as well as its calming health benefits. Sinful and divine, this is one of the most popular of Rajasthani foods that will titillate your taste buds with its exotic looks and taste.</p>
<p><strong>Jaipuri Mewa Pulao</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9316" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-mewa-Pulao.jpg" alt="Jaipuri mewa Pulao" width="900" height="522" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-mewa-Pulao.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-mewa-Pulao-300x174.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-mewa-Pulao-768x445.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>In its very name, this dish speaks of the essence of Jaipur it encompasses in it delicious grains of sweet rice. Essentially and evidently sweet, this nuts pilaf is a rich rice preparation in ghee, milk and sugar with of course dried fruits and powdered spices enhancing further its decadence. In being a wholesome meal in itself, this very aromatic dish would definitely be among the more famous food of Jaipur. In its medley of sweetness, this Mewa Pulao seems to embody the pink essence of Jaipur. Pleasurable to the palate in its flavours as the city is to the eyes, in its brocaded expanse of pink shimmers.</p>
<p><strong>Kadhi</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9318" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kadhi.jpg" alt="Kadhi" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kadhi.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kadhi-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kadhi-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>As the pink pleasantries of Jaipur soothe your eyes and blesses your soul, it’s time to let your taste buds also soak the comfy warmth of a hearty Rajasthani meal. And what better than a serving of the authentic Kadhi to bring to you the euphoria of a taste well-deserved? While this pan <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/famous-indian-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indian dish</a> is by no means an exclusive Rajasthani specialty, there sure is a different feel to it when you devour a bowl of this comfort in the pretty ambience of the pink city. Enriched with the goodness of dahi or yogurt, the Kadhi in Jaipur is a bowl of refreshing flavours. Spicy yet soothing, now that’s a combination you do not get to indulge in every single day!</p>
<p><strong>Gajak</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9312" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gajak.jpg" alt="Gajak" width="900" height="540" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gajak.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gajak-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gajak-768x461.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Rajasthan is popular for its panoply of sweet delights, with each city of the state specialising in some exquisite treats of its own. And one such sweet food stuff very famous in Jaipur is the Gajak. A nutritious yet delightful sweet, gajak is simply sesame seeds roasted, sweetened and shaped into thin squares. While Gajak is a sweet widely popular across northern India, the ones from Jaipur are distinctive in their own identity. With also some cashews thrown in into this healthy treat, Jaipuri Gajaks can indeed be a wholesome addiction.</p>
<p><strong>Makhan Bada</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9320" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Makhan-Bada.jpg" alt="Makhan Bada" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Makhan-Bada.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Makhan-Bada-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Makhan-Bada-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Another very succulent sweet that stems from the stunning expanse of Jaipur is the Makkhan Bada. Quite rich in its very name, this melt in the mouth sweet however is a brittle caramel delicacy. These deep fried balls of Maida and curd make for one of the most interesting Diwali sweets in Rajasthan. Sweet, syrupy and sizzling, this soft and flaky sweet comes loaded with lots and lots of ghee for the authentic royal Rajasthani experience.</p>
<p><strong>Jaipuri Murgh Masala</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9317" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-Murgh-Masala.jpg" alt="Jaipuri Murgh Masala" width="900" height="547" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-Murgh-Masala.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-Murgh-Masala-300x182.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-Murgh-Masala-768x467.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Trust a city resting in a state known for housing the largest proportion of vegetarians in the country to come with a non-veg recipe exclusive to it! That’s indeed what the city of Jaipur unravels itself to be-a foodie haven in all its varied servings of delicacies. Jaipuri murgh masala happens to be the classic Jaipuri take on the chicken recipe. A creamy chicken curry that makes this delectable dish worthy of a royal spread, this is undoubtedly one of the most famous among the limited non vegetarian picks you can relish while in Jaipur. Delicious, hot and spicy, this one makes the case for indulgence!</p>
<p><strong>Gulab Sakri</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9314" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gulab-Sakri.jpg" alt="Gulab Sakri" width="900" height="593" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gulab-Sakri.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gulab-Sakri-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gulab-Sakri-768x506.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Deceptive in being a Gulab Sakri sans any trace of Gulaab, it perhaps is the lineage of this sweet tracing to the pink city that renders it its characteristic name. Incorporating the richness of condensed milk and Mawa with the equally regal flavour of saffron this is however a sweet lesser known. When in Jaipur however, you cannot miss having a bite of this unusual food and help make it all the more famous, as it deserves to be!</p>
<p><strong>Pitod Ki Sabji</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9324" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pitod-Ki-Sabji.jpg" alt="Pitod Ki Sabji" width="900" height="589" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pitod-Ki-Sabji.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pitod-Ki-Sabji-300x196.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pitod-Ki-Sabji-768x503.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Call it the classic lockdown recipe of the present when veggies are hard to be found but the Jaipuri Pitod Ki Sabjiis a lip smacking dish. Almost akin to the more famous Gatte ki Sabzi, this food preparation takes centerstage not just in Jaipur but in the whole of Rajasthan. Made with pantry staples like gram flour and curd, this healthy and nutritious traditional dish also tastes quite amazing with even just a couple of ingredients.</p>
<p><strong>Dal Chawal Kath</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9311" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dal-Chawal-Kath.jpg" alt="Dal Chawal Kath" width="900" height="567" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dal-Chawal-Kath.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dal-Chawal-Kath-300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dal-Chawal-Kath-768x484.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Though not exactly a regional specialty in Jaipur, Dal Chawal Kath finds way into our menu because of its characteristic uniqueness. An authentic Rajasthani recipe that however remains lesser known, this combo preparation is a complete meal in itself. Simpler than the ever popular dal baati churma in preparation and therefore a more prevalent item in everyday food affairs, this is a recipe that incorporates diverse flavours. While the rice is paired with an untempered dal preparation, it is the Kath preparation that is most distinctive. A form of Rasam, Kath is a sweet and sour preparation from rice starch, tamarind water and the Kaathi Dal. In its quite diversive and refreshing taste, this definitely is a dish designed to ward off the typical Rajasthani heat.</p>
<p><strong>Moong Dal Halwa</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9323" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Moong-Dal-Halwa.jpg" alt="Moong Dal Halwa" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Moong-Dal-Halwa.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Moong-Dal-Halwa-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Moong-Dal-Halwa-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>A classic Indian winter specialty and a popular food in Jaipur is the utterly delectable serving of Moong dal Halwa. A standout among the many types of Halwas because of its nutty texture and heavenly taste, this is a divine indulgence. Oozing oodles of ghee and bursting with a sweet flavor that so complements the uncharacteristic taste of the lentils makes this dessert an absolute favorite among all sweet lovers in the country.</p>
<p><strong>Bajre ki Khichdi</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9309" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bajre-ki-Khichdi.jpg" alt="Bajre ki Khichdi" width="800" height="646" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bajre-ki-Khichdi.jpg 800w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bajre-ki-Khichdi-300x242.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bajre-ki-Khichdi-768x620.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>This one might sound like too plaintive a dish to rave about as all famous and stuff but this popular food in Jaipur happens also to be rather distinctive. Made with bajra instead of rice, this is a khichdi even healthier than the traditional Dal- Chawal versions. However, what makes this particular Khichdi also a pleasant surprise is its unusual serving style. Jaipurites relish a good of’ Thali of Bajre ki Khichdi with some ghee and powdered sugar on top!</p>
<p><strong>Makki ki Ghat</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9321" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Makki-ki-Ghat.jpg" alt="Makki ki Ghat" width="686" height="386" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Makki-ki-Ghat.jpg 686w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Makki-ki-Ghat-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" /></p>
<p>A traditional breakfast dish in Jaipur is Makki ki Ghat, celebrated for its wholesome goodness. This simple yet versatile corn Daliya can be prepared either sweet or savory, catering to various tastes. Particularly favored during the chilly winter months, it offers a hearty and satisfying meal to start the day.</p>

<p>Believe us or not, Jaipur so deliciously churns out its veggie chunks in food preparations that Sabji Jaipuri is a famous recipe in its own! A colorful dish that is as delicious as it is healthy, this Jaipuri style of veggie preparation assorts up everything from tender potatoes and cauliflowers and green beans to peas and carrots and tomatoes and onions in a creamy cashew sauce to churn up a dish that tastes absolutely divine. Jaipur sure knows how to shower love on its vegetables as well!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The train sped away, the trees looking as if they were racing with us. The compartment was eerily quiet after the small confusion that we had at the previous station. There was a family which got into the wrong train quite inadvertently and it was a complete confusion how to convince them that they were in the wrong train. They were from Andhra and didn’t know a word of Hindi or English. Finally it took a pantry fellow who happened to speak their language, to convince them about their predicament. The very next station found the train halting and the Andhra family being escorted to the station master’s room. The train was now headed towards Jaipur. The very mention of Jaipur sends a thousand bells ringing in my sister’s ears. She had asked for a lehenga Choli and slippers called Mojris from Jaipur. Yes. I often visit this city as our company headquarters is here in this historical city. It was Borning to go to any place alone but work demands I finish my project on time. So with my laptop bag beside me and a small valise under the seat, I waited for the station to come so that I could jump out and feel free.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4428" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Jantar-Mantar-Jaipur.jpg" alt="Jantar Mantar" width="741" height="486" /><br />
I had actually thought of getting off at Agra Fort Station and have a look at the Taj Mahal. But I had to report at night at the hotel that was booked for me. I had come with my delegation as part of a ten member committee for the International Conference at Jaipur. So I had to be there on time.</p>
<p>The early morning sun rays shone through the crack on the roof of the shade that was built in Jaipur station. The whole ambience looked like we were in a kind of documentary on Rajasthan. Suddenly the hues and shades turned into pink, yellow, green and bright Colors. That is one thing about Jaipur and Rajasthan. The Vibrant Colours Anyway I had come with minimal luggage and soon checked into the hotel after being ushered into the car that was waiting for me. The other members were already there and we had an elaborate breakfast after a quick shower. We had to prepare for the next day’s presentation. Roy, my colleague and Krish, another acquaintance asked if we could go and have a look at the city’s monumental architecture. I agreed immediately and quietly suggested, “Jantar Mantar. I want to see that structure.’</p>
<p>The other two agreed and as we were getting into the car, Pamela came rushing in. Pamela was the universal assistant of our firm and was ever ready with the best kind of trivia on any issue. She just hopped into the car. That was Pamela. No inhibitions, no hanky Panky.</p>
<p>Gathering her breath, she asked “Where are you all going? I am so bored here.”</p>
<p>“Jantar Mantar.” All the three of us said. “Oh No!” she said “I have been there umpteen times.”</p>
<p>We told here another time wouldn’t matter and she reluctantly agreed. “so do you not have any trivia about Jantar Mantar?” Roy asked munching into a brownie he brought from the breakfast table. Roy was a gourmand and loved to eat. In spite of his senior position in the company, amongst friends he was an easy going person.</p>
<p>Pamela, pushing her hair back said,” Yes, Jantar Mantar. Uh..hum..It is an astronomical observatory. Maharaja Jai Singh built it. Taking out a chewing gum, and offering it to us, she continued,” It is the biggest and the best amongst observatories that have been built by the Maharaja. He was a very avid astronomer you know.”</p>
<p>“Bas Bas,” Krish said meaning enough in Hindi. “Phew! Pam, you talk so much.”</p>
<p>Pamela giggled and said she was going to take a short nap and to tell here when we reach Jantar Mantar.</p>
<p>But when was it built?” probed Roy, triggering off another pool of data from Pam! “Oh!” she continued it was built between the years 1728 and 1734. It is today the most logical kind of stone landscape. There are many instruments in Jantar Mantar which show the temperature and the amount of heat that the season would have, if there would be a famine etc.</p>
<p>“Okay, I have Tidbit information too.” I added. Everyone looked towards me and I said that the Jantar Mantar was a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>The three of them said “Hey! We knew that.” Laughing we just looked at the scene outside. It was beautiful with the desert sand showing up with intermittent greenery cropping up. The whole area looked like a desert yet there was lot of activity.</p>
<p>Finally we reached Jantar Mantar. There was a guide there whom we paid a nominal amount and he took us on a guided tour around the structure. I had always seen the structure in text books, charts, pictures. Today, as I stood there looking at this huge marvel of architectural intelligence, I could only just stand there and gape at it like a fool. The name perhaps had some connection with the words Instrument and calculations. So the place looked very much in sync with the name Jantar Mantar. The City palace of Jaipur was very near Jantar Mantar. The simple structures around just completely overwhelmed us. Being engineers, we could understand that the whole structure had been built with a purpose and objective. The geometric angle to the entire structure was evident even to a layman. These are the features that attracted it to tourists. I have heard my mother telling me how she had come here as a student and had asked me to see the phenomena of calculation of time, prediction of eclipse instruments etc. There were also methods of tracking stars in the orbit and one could see some other astronomical activities also. The instruments found here are ancient and thus are found to be made of marble sandstone.</p>
<p>As we walked around with the guide ranting away things which we didn’t want to hear. Pamela was grinning as she knew that we felt her trivia was better than his.! The observatory was obviously entirely made up of stone and marble.</p>
<p>Pamela said,” See each of the instruments here is made with a specific purpose.” This timeless beautiful structure just quietly bore testimony to so much history that I was just too mesmerized to concentrate on what she was saying. I could see the melee of the tourists here included everyone from old men to confidently striding old women, students to teachers, astrologers to budding scientists, historians to people like us.</p>
<p>The guide was saying, “There are fourteen astronomical instruments here. Each instrument is important.”</p>
<p>“But the Vrihat Samrat Yantra is the most attractive, “Pam said. “Yes, yes,” the guide continued and said that it means it is the Sundial that Pam was talking about. We saw that at the left of the entrance the Laghu Samrat Yantra was there. This was the small sundial. This small sundial dealt with calculating the declination of all the bodies celestially.</p>
<p><strong>We therefore went on a tour of the Yantra:</strong></p>
<p>The in house guide explained to us how the instruments worked. First we saw the Narivalaya Yantra. This was a sundial which was used to calculate time with the help of the solar cycle. There were two hemispheres which were inclined at 27 degrees.</p>
<p>The next instrument we saw was the Unnatansha Yantra. The guide explained that this was used to find out the actual position of the stars and planets at any point of day or night.</p>
<p>The next instrument we saw was the Laghu Samrat yantra. Pamela said, “I know this. This is a small sundial that was built on 27 degrees north. This incidentally is the latitude where Jaipur lies. This was used to calculate the local time at Jaipur.” The guide said, “Yes she is right and the accuracy of calculation is as close as 20 seconds.”</p>
<p>Chakra Yantra – This was the next instrument we saw. The instrument looked like some brass tubes. These tubes appeared to pass through the middle of the metal instruments which were two in number. The guide said that this instrument was used to deduct the angle at which the stars and planets passed the equator.</p>
<p>We were quite enlightened about the old pattern of application of science and we were just enriched with information which was easy to comprehend and not beyond understanding. I wished college studies were as easy and as practical. The Ram Yantra was what we saw next. This looked like two rock circles like Stonehenge. There were vertical columns which supported some horizontal slabs. Pannalal, the guide said that this was used to find out the length of the celestial arc from the horizon to the zenith. “Isn’t It also used to measure the altitude of the sun&gt;?” asked Pamela. The guide nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder why Pamela knows so much but now I was proud of her. She really was well informed. Even though she claimed that it was only because her father was from Jaipur that she knew this place well, yet the memory recall was really commendable. We then saw an instrument which looked like there were two bowls which were sunk into the floor.</p>
<p>Pannalal said “Maharaja Jai Singh himself constructed this instrument. This instrument is the one which measures the accuracy of all other instruments here”. A collective gasp went around the crowd as everyone looked at this mother of all instruments.</p>
<p>The next that we saw was the Rashivalaya Yantra which came in a set of 12 pieces. The 12 pieces were for the 12 signs of the zodiac. The angle and the constellation were different. The astrologers make use of this to predict horoscopes.</p>
<p>“Whoa! What is this?” I exclaimed as I saw a tall structure.”</p>
<p>“This is the sundial which used to forecast the crop growth for the entire year.” Pannalal continued.</p>
<p>“And it measures 75ft.” completed Pamela fanning my sweating brow. “don’t break into a sweat Shonu, this is not over yet, you have a look at other structures in Jaipur, and you would need a stock of sweat to perspire and imagine what a great country we are in.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Pam, true, the place is really amazingly magnificent and intriguing.”</p>
<p>We had to get back to the hotel as we had to prepare for the next day’s presentation. But the first thing I did after getting back, was write this blog. As memories flood my mind, nostalgia also takes over as I feel like going back to Jantar Mantar, Meet Pannalal, live the experience called Jantar Mantar again. I wished Jantar Mantar had a time machine which would then take us to the time when this was constructed so that we could see what it was that existed in the minds of those intelligent brains that made this landmark in Indian monuments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of the many architectural wonders that line the corners of Jaipur, the Nahargarh Fort has carved a special place for itself. Located just a few kilometers away from Jaigarh Fort, the Nahargarh Fort has its own story to tell.</p>
<p>This fort is located quite near to the main area of the pink city. All you have to do is take a car or taxi or even an auto from the best hotel in Jaipur where you will be staying, tell the driver where you want to go and he will take you there!<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2703" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nahargarh-Fort.jpg" alt="Nahargarh Fort" width="741" height="486" /><br />
There are various reasons that make Nahargarh an interesting place to explore. There are many facts about this place, which hardly any tourist knows about. Let’s take a look at some of the most interesting and intriguing facts about this piece of architectural brilliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Nahargarh Fort is almost 700 ft tall!</li>
<li>The main purpose behind building this fort was that it would protect the main area of the city in case of a siege. However, after this, the city had never faced any siege!</li>
<li>The Nahargarh Fort was built in order to protect the city. So naturally, it was filled with arms and ammunitions. However, since they never got a chance to use these fire arms, they were used to mark time! Instead of a bell that announced the time to the city, gunfire worked as the signal.</li>
<li>Okay so the main part of this fort is the Madhavendra Bhawan. This place is what can be termed as the chambers for all the numerous queens that the king had. There are a total of 12 chambers in this region, where each of which is connected. Beautiful frescos and paintings adorn the walls of these chambers and the passageways. However, the chambers are designed and connected in such a way so that no queen would ever find, in whose chamber the king decided to spend some time! This was done in order not to promote jealousy amongst the 12 queens, each of who vied for the king’s attention.</li>
<li>Since the walls of this fort are beautiful and have born the test of time quite gracefully, it is a place where a number of popular Bollywood films have been shot.</li>
<li>Sawai Ram Singh was the King of Jaipur during the 1857 revolt. Since the kings had already signed a pact with the British to ensure their stability, many British officers were sent to Nahargarh Fort to protect them from the danger of the mutineers, which up till then had almost all the facilities that a good hotel in Jaipur would have had.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from these really interesting anecdotes about the fort, here’s a little story about how the fort came to be named:</p>
<p>It was Sawai Jai Singh, who had commissioned the construction of this massive structure. Supposedly the land on which he was building this fort was of Nahar Singh Bhomia’s whose spirit hampered the work! It was only when Jai Singh promised to name the fort after Nahar Singh that these disturbances stopped.</p>
<p>Legends and anecdotes combined, Nahargarh does make for an excellent place to visit when you travel to Jaipur.</p>
