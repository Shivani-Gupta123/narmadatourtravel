										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The renowned Pink City of <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/rajasthan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rajasthan</a>, <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/jaipur" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaipur</a>, dazzles with its vibrant colors and royal heritage. Equally captivating is its diverse culinary scene, where each dish tells a story. From sweet to savory, and spicy to tangy, the flavors of Jaipur create a truly royal palate. Unique, exotic, and utterly irresistible, the culinary experience here is a feast for the senses. Here’s a roundup of the must-try dishes in Jaipur that will enrich your travel tale with unforgettable flavors.</p>
<h3><strong>Dal Bati Churma</strong></h3>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9310" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dal-Bati-Churma.jpeg" alt="Dal Bati Churma" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dal-Bati-Churma.jpeg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dal-Bati-Churma-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dal-Bati-Churma-768x432.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>No matter in which color coded city you land up in while in Rajasthan, you definitely would be only better off digging into the very traditional fare of Dal Bati Churma. One of the most distinctive foods of the many Indian states, this staple of Rajasthan also enjoys equal esteem in Jaipur.</p>
<p>A dish as steeped in tradition as it is in taste, Dal Baati Churma is in fact a diversive meal in its trio encompassment. Wheat flour doughs are shaped like balls and baked in traditional ovens, giving them their charred appearance and characteristic flavour. These Batis are broken and done up with a serving of panchmel dal that is also a nutritious mix, comprising of five types of lentils.</p>
<p>Churma on the other hand is the dessert component of this ‘three course meal’ that is also as interesting a food on its own. Crushed batis are roasted in ghee and then are sweetened with sugar or jaggery and flavored with fragrant spices. There’s nothing that quite matches the taste of smoky baatis savored with some delicious savoury dal and done up with the sweetened churma. Unique, flavorful and popular like no dish else, a taste of Jaipur wouldn’t be the same without this signature classic.</p>

<p><strong>Mawa Kachori</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9322" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Mawa-Kachori.jpg" alt="Mawa Kachori" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Mawa-Kachori.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Mawa-Kachori-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Mawa-Kachori-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Rajasthan already is famous enough for its Kachoris. Not the dry, lentil stuffed ones that we encounter everywhere throughout India. Kachoris of the royal state tend to be as much royal, as they come with a generous filling of an onion mixture. But even in its transgressing way with the Kachori, Pyaaz Kachori would hardly be the most exotic dish ever. That credit should rather go to the more daring and more awe inspiring Mawa Kachori.</p>
<p>Even when a sweet Kachori would be unheard of in other parts of the country, in Jaipur this dainty disc of dripping decadence is a routine delight. A rich preparation that includes mawa as the filling of the Kachori in place of the spicy masala, Mawa Kachoris takes a generous dip in some sensuous sugar syrup making this sticky, sweet treat a real euphoria for the senses.</p>
<p><strong>Keema Baati</strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9319" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Keema-Baati.jpg" alt="Keema Baati" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Keema-Baati.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Keema-Baati-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Keema-Baati-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Largely a vegetarian state, Rajasthan throws up quite some pleasant surprises even in its non-veg menu. One such unique food that makes up for among the more famous stuff in Jaipur is Keema Baati. Once again at play in this authentic food is the Baati the state is almost ubiquitous with. But this time around the Baatis come stuffed with minced and spiced mutton meat. Quite a spicy treat in the Keema being mixed with a number of spices, this deep fried or preferably baked, rich and rustic dish allows for a really vibrant explosion of flavours in your mouth.</p>

<p><strong>Jaipuri Aloo Pyaaz ki Sabzi</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9315" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-Aloo-Pyaaz-ki-Sabzi.jpg" alt="Jaipuri Aloo Pyaaz ki Sabzi" width="900" height="576" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-Aloo-Pyaaz-ki-Sabzi.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-Aloo-Pyaaz-ki-Sabzi-300x192.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-Aloo-Pyaaz-ki-Sabzi-768x492.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Despite its grand architecture and princely pink premises, Jaipur remains a royal land steeped in simplicity. Which makes even the most simplest of stuff part of its culinary history. One such very humble preparation that is a famous food in Jaipur is the ubiquitous Jaipuri Aloo Pyaaz ki Sabzi. Ghee fried potatoes and onions are simmered in a spicy buttery tomato gravy to deliver a dish that boasts of a melt in your mouth texture. In its flavorful essence and rich taste, this dish smacks of the royal heritage of Rajasthan even in its simplistic soul.</p>
<p><strong>Ghevar</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9313" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ghevar.jpg" alt="Ghevar" width="900" height="598" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ghevar.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ghevar-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ghevar-768x510.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The Dal Bati Churma of sweets in Rajasthan is the delicately delicious sweetmeat called Ghevar. Tracing its roots to Jaipur, this is one food famous throughout the country for its very different taste and texture. Unlike most other Indian sweets you would have tasted, Ghevar is an immensely rich dessert. The honeycomb like disc-shaped cake made with all-purpose flour and soaked in sugar syrup is a firm favorite, for its delectable goodness as well as its calming health benefits. Sinful and divine, this is one of the most popular of Rajasthani foods that will titillate your taste buds with its exotic looks and taste.</p>
<p><strong>Jaipuri Mewa Pulao</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9316" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-mewa-Pulao.jpg" alt="Jaipuri mewa Pulao" width="900" height="522" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-mewa-Pulao.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-mewa-Pulao-300x174.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-mewa-Pulao-768x445.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>In its very name, this dish speaks of the essence of Jaipur it encompasses in it delicious grains of sweet rice. Essentially and evidently sweet, this nuts pilaf is a rich rice preparation in ghee, milk and sugar with of course dried fruits and powdered spices enhancing further its decadence. In being a wholesome meal in itself, this very aromatic dish would definitely be among the more famous food of Jaipur. In its medley of sweetness, this Mewa Pulao seems to embody the pink essence of Jaipur. Pleasurable to the palate in its flavours as the city is to the eyes, in its brocaded expanse of pink shimmers.</p>
<p><strong>Kadhi</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9318" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kadhi.jpg" alt="Kadhi" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kadhi.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kadhi-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kadhi-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>As the pink pleasantries of Jaipur soothe your eyes and blesses your soul, it’s time to let your taste buds also soak the comfy warmth of a hearty Rajasthani meal. And what better than a serving of the authentic Kadhi to bring to you the euphoria of a taste well-deserved? While this pan <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/famous-indian-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indian dish</a> is by no means an exclusive Rajasthani specialty, there sure is a different feel to it when you devour a bowl of this comfort in the pretty ambience of the pink city. Enriched with the goodness of dahi or yogurt, the Kadhi in Jaipur is a bowl of refreshing flavours. Spicy yet soothing, now that’s a combination you do not get to indulge in every single day!</p>
<p><strong>Gajak</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9312" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gajak.jpg" alt="Gajak" width="900" height="540" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gajak.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gajak-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gajak-768x461.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Rajasthan is popular for its panoply of sweet delights, with each city of the state specialising in some exquisite treats of its own. And one such sweet food stuff very famous in Jaipur is the Gajak. A nutritious yet delightful sweet, gajak is simply sesame seeds roasted, sweetened and shaped into thin squares. While Gajak is a sweet widely popular across northern India, the ones from Jaipur are distinctive in their own identity. With also some cashews thrown in into this healthy treat, Jaipuri Gajaks can indeed be a wholesome addiction.</p>
<p><strong>Makhan Bada</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9320" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Makhan-Bada.jpg" alt="Makhan Bada" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Makhan-Bada.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Makhan-Bada-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Makhan-Bada-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Another very succulent sweet that stems from the stunning expanse of Jaipur is the Makkhan Bada. Quite rich in its very name, this melt in the mouth sweet however is a brittle caramel delicacy. These deep fried balls of Maida and curd make for one of the most interesting Diwali sweets in Rajasthan. Sweet, syrupy and sizzling, this soft and flaky sweet comes loaded with lots and lots of ghee for the authentic royal Rajasthani experience.</p>
<p><strong>Jaipuri Murgh Masala</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9317" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-Murgh-Masala.jpg" alt="Jaipuri Murgh Masala" width="900" height="547" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-Murgh-Masala.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-Murgh-Masala-300x182.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jaipuri-Murgh-Masala-768x467.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Trust a city resting in a state known for housing the largest proportion of vegetarians in the country to come with a non-veg recipe exclusive to it! That’s indeed what the city of Jaipur unravels itself to be-a foodie haven in all its varied servings of delicacies. Jaipuri murgh masala happens to be the classic Jaipuri take on the chicken recipe. A creamy chicken curry that makes this delectable dish worthy of a royal spread, this is undoubtedly one of the most famous among the limited non vegetarian picks you can relish while in Jaipur. Delicious, hot and spicy, this one makes the case for indulgence!</p>
<p><strong>Gulab Sakri</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9314" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gulab-Sakri.jpg" alt="Gulab Sakri" width="900" height="593" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gulab-Sakri.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gulab-Sakri-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Gulab-Sakri-768x506.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Deceptive in being a Gulab Sakri sans any trace of Gulaab, it perhaps is the lineage of this sweet tracing to the pink city that renders it its characteristic name. Incorporating the richness of condensed milk and Mawa with the equally regal flavour of saffron this is however a sweet lesser known. When in Jaipur however, you cannot miss having a bite of this unusual food and help make it all the more famous, as it deserves to be!</p>
<p><strong>Pitod Ki Sabji</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9324" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pitod-Ki-Sabji.jpg" alt="Pitod Ki Sabji" width="900" height="589" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pitod-Ki-Sabji.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pitod-Ki-Sabji-300x196.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Pitod-Ki-Sabji-768x503.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Call it the classic lockdown recipe of the present when veggies are hard to be found but the Jaipuri Pitod Ki Sabjiis a lip smacking dish. Almost akin to the more famous Gatte ki Sabzi, this food preparation takes centerstage not just in Jaipur but in the whole of Rajasthan. Made with pantry staples like gram flour and curd, this healthy and nutritious traditional dish also tastes quite amazing with even just a couple of ingredients.</p>
<p><strong>Dal Chawal Kath</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9311" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dal-Chawal-Kath.jpg" alt="Dal Chawal Kath" width="900" height="567" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dal-Chawal-Kath.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dal-Chawal-Kath-300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dal-Chawal-Kath-768x484.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Though not exactly a regional specialty in Jaipur, Dal Chawal Kath finds way into our menu because of its characteristic uniqueness. An authentic Rajasthani recipe that however remains lesser known, this combo preparation is a complete meal in itself. Simpler than the ever popular dal baati churma in preparation and therefore a more prevalent item in everyday food affairs, this is a recipe that incorporates diverse flavours. While the rice is paired with an untempered dal preparation, it is the Kath preparation that is most distinctive. A form of Rasam, Kath is a sweet and sour preparation from rice starch, tamarind water and the Kaathi Dal. In its quite diversive and refreshing taste, this definitely is a dish designed to ward off the typical Rajasthani heat.</p>
<p><strong>Moong Dal Halwa</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9323" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Moong-Dal-Halwa.jpg" alt="Moong Dal Halwa" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Moong-Dal-Halwa.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Moong-Dal-Halwa-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Moong-Dal-Halwa-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>A classic Indian winter specialty and a popular food in Jaipur is the utterly delectable serving of Moong dal Halwa. A standout among the many types of Halwas because of its nutty texture and heavenly taste, this is a divine indulgence. Oozing oodles of ghee and bursting with a sweet flavor that so complements the uncharacteristic taste of the lentils makes this dessert an absolute favorite among all sweet lovers in the country.</p>
<p><strong>Bajre ki Khichdi</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9309" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bajre-ki-Khichdi.jpg" alt="Bajre ki Khichdi" width="800" height="646" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bajre-ki-Khichdi.jpg 800w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bajre-ki-Khichdi-300x242.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Bajre-ki-Khichdi-768x620.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>This one might sound like too plaintive a dish to rave about as all famous and stuff but this popular food in Jaipur happens also to be rather distinctive. Made with bajra instead of rice, this is a khichdi even healthier than the traditional Dal- Chawal versions. However, what makes this particular Khichdi also a pleasant surprise is its unusual serving style. Jaipurites relish a good of’ Thali of Bajre ki Khichdi with some ghee and powdered sugar on top!</p>
<p><strong>Makki ki Ghat</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9321" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Makki-ki-Ghat.jpg" alt="Makki ki Ghat" width="686" height="386" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Makki-ki-Ghat.jpg 686w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Makki-ki-Ghat-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" /></p>
<p>A traditional breakfast dish in Jaipur is Makki ki Ghat, celebrated for its wholesome goodness. This simple yet versatile corn Daliya can be prepared either sweet or savory, catering to various tastes. Particularly favored during the chilly winter months, it offers a hearty and satisfying meal to start the day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The train sped away, the trees looking as if they were racing with us. The compartment was eerily quiet after the small confusion that we had at the previous station. There was a family which got into the wrong train quite inadvertently and it was a complete confusion how to convince them that they were in the wrong train. They were from Andhra and didn’t know a word of Hindi or English. Finally it took a pantry fellow who happened to speak their language, to convince them about their predicament. The very next station found the train halting and the Andhra family being escorted to the station master’s room. The train was now headed towards Jaipur. The very mention of Jaipur sends a thousand bells ringing in my sister’s ears. She had asked for a lehenga Choli and slippers called Mojris from Jaipur. Yes. I often visit this city as our company headquarters is here in this historical city. It was Borning to go to any place alone but work demands I finish my project on time. So with my laptop bag beside me and a small valise under the seat, I waited for the station to come so that I could jump out and feel free.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4428" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Jantar-Mantar-Jaipur.jpg" alt="Jantar Mantar" width="741" height="486" /><br />
I had actually thought of getting off at Agra Fort Station and have a look at the Taj Mahal. But I had to report at night at the hotel that was booked for me. I had come with my delegation as part of a ten member committee for the International Conference at Jaipur. So I had to be there on time.</p>
<p>The early morning sun rays shone through the crack on the roof of the shade that was built in Jaipur station. The whole ambience looked like we were in a kind of documentary on Rajasthan. Suddenly the hues and shades turned into pink, yellow, green and bright Colors. That is one thing about Jaipur and Rajasthan. The Vibrant Colours Anyway I had come with minimal luggage and soon checked into the hotel after being ushered into the car that was waiting for me. The other members were already there and we had an elaborate breakfast after a quick shower. We had to prepare for the next day’s presentation. Roy, my colleague and Krish, another acquaintance asked if we could go and have a look at the city’s monumental architecture. I agreed immediately and quietly suggested, “Jantar Mantar. I want to see that structure.’</p>
<p>The other two agreed and as we were getting into the car, Pamela came rushing in. Pamela was the universal assistant of our firm and was ever ready with the best kind of trivia on any issue. She just hopped into the car. That was Pamela. No inhibitions, no hanky Panky.</p>
<p>Gathering her breath, she asked “Where are you all going? I am so bored here.”</p>
<p>“Jantar Mantar.” All the three of us said. “Oh No!” she said “I have been there umpteen times.”</p>
<p>We told here another time wouldn’t matter and she reluctantly agreed. “so do you not have any trivia about Jantar Mantar?” Roy asked munching into a brownie he brought from the breakfast table. Roy was a gourmand and loved to eat. In spite of his senior position in the company, amongst friends he was an easy going person.</p>
<p>Pamela, pushing her hair back said,” Yes, Jantar Mantar. Uh..hum..It is an astronomical observatory. Maharaja Jai Singh built it. Taking out a chewing gum, and offering it to us, she continued,” It is the biggest and the best amongst observatories that have been built by the Maharaja. He was a very avid astronomer you know.”</p>
<p>“Bas Bas,” Krish said meaning enough in Hindi. “Phew! Pam, you talk so much.”</p>
<p>Pamela giggled and said she was going to take a short nap and to tell here when we reach Jantar Mantar.</p>
<p>But when was it built?” probed Roy, triggering off another pool of data from Pam! “Oh!” she continued it was built between the years 1728 and 1734. It is today the most logical kind of stone landscape. There are many instruments in Jantar Mantar which show the temperature and the amount of heat that the season would have, if there would be a famine etc.</p>
<p>“Okay, I have Tidbit information too.” I added. Everyone looked towards me and I said that the Jantar Mantar was a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>The three of them said “Hey! We knew that.” Laughing we just looked at the scene outside. It was beautiful with the desert sand showing up with intermittent greenery cropping up. The whole area looked like a desert yet there was lot of activity.</p>
<p>Finally we reached Jantar Mantar. There was a guide there whom we paid a nominal amount and he took us on a guided tour around the structure. I had always seen the structure in text books, charts, pictures. Today, as I stood there looking at this huge marvel of architectural intelligence, I could only just stand there and gape at it like a fool. The name perhaps had some connection with the words Instrument and calculations. So the place looked very much in sync with the name Jantar Mantar. The City palace of Jaipur was very near Jantar Mantar. The simple structures around just completely overwhelmed us. Being engineers, we could understand that the whole structure had been built with a purpose and objective. The geometric angle to the entire structure was evident even to a layman. These are the features that attracted it to tourists. I have heard my mother telling me how she had come here as a student and had asked me to see the phenomena of calculation of time, prediction of eclipse instruments etc. There were also methods of tracking stars in the orbit and one could see some other astronomical activities also. The instruments found here are ancient and thus are found to be made of marble sandstone.</p>
<p>As we walked around with the guide ranting away things which we didn’t want to hear. Pamela was grinning as she knew that we felt her trivia was better than his.! The observatory was obviously entirely made up of stone and marble.</p>
<p>Pamela said,” See each of the instruments here is made with a specific purpose.” This timeless beautiful structure just quietly bore testimony to so much history that I was just too mesmerized to concentrate on what she was saying. I could see the melee of the tourists here included everyone from old men to confidently striding old women, students to teachers, astrologers to budding scientists, historians to people like us.</p>
<p>The guide was saying, “There are fourteen astronomical instruments here. Each instrument is important.”</p>
<p>“But the Vrihat Samrat Yantra is the most attractive, “Pam said. “Yes, yes,” the guide continued and said that it means it is the Sundial that Pam was talking about. We saw that at the left of the entrance the Laghu Samrat Yantra was there. This was the small sundial. This small sundial dealt with calculating the declination of all the bodies celestially.</p>
<p><strong>We therefore went on a tour of the Yantra:</strong></p>
<p>The in house guide explained to us how the instruments worked. First we saw the Narivalaya Yantra. This was a sundial which was used to calculate time with the help of the solar cycle. There were two hemispheres which were inclined at 27 degrees.</p>
<p>The next instrument we saw was the Unnatansha Yantra. The guide explained that this was used to find out the actual position of the stars and planets at any point of day or night.</p>
<p>The next instrument we saw was the Laghu Samrat yantra. Pamela said, “I know this. This is a small sundial that was built on 27 degrees north. This incidentally is the latitude where Jaipur lies. This was used to calculate the local time at Jaipur.” The guide said, “Yes she is right and the accuracy of calculation is as close as 20 seconds.”</p>
<p>Chakra Yantra – This was the next instrument we saw. The instrument looked like some brass tubes. These tubes appeared to pass through the middle of the metal instruments which were two in number. The guide said that this instrument was used to deduct the angle at which the stars and planets passed the equator.</p>
<p>We were quite enlightened about the old pattern of application of science and we were just enriched with information which was easy to comprehend and not beyond understanding. I wished college studies were as easy and as practical. The Ram Yantra was what we saw next. This looked like two rock circles like Stonehenge. There were vertical columns which supported some horizontal slabs. Pannalal, the guide said that this was used to find out the length of the celestial arc from the horizon to the zenith. “Isn’t It also used to measure the altitude of the sun&gt;?” asked Pamela. The guide nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder why Pamela knows so much but now I was proud of her. She really was well informed. Even though she claimed that it was only because her father was from Jaipur that she knew this place well, yet the memory recall was really commendable. We then saw an instrument which looked like there were two bowls which were sunk into the floor.</p>
<p>Pannalal said “Maharaja Jai Singh himself constructed this instrument. This instrument is the one which measures the accuracy of all other instruments here”. A collective gasp went around the crowd as everyone looked at this mother of all instruments.</p>
<p>The next that we saw was the Rashivalaya Yantra which came in a set of 12 pieces. The 12 pieces were for the 12 signs of the zodiac. The angle and the constellation were different. The astrologers make use of this to predict horoscopes.</p>
<p>“Whoa! What is this?” I exclaimed as I saw a tall structure.”</p>
<p>“This is the sundial which used to forecast the crop growth for the entire year.” Pannalal continued.</p>
<p>“And it measures 75ft.” completed Pamela fanning my sweating brow. “don’t break into a sweat Shonu, this is not over yet, you have a look at other structures in Jaipur, and you would need a stock of sweat to perspire and imagine what a great country we are in.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Pam, true, the place is really amazingly magnificent and intriguing.”</p>
<p>We had to get back to the hotel as we had to prepare for the next day’s presentation. But the first thing I did after getting back, was write this blog. As memories flood my mind, nostalgia also takes over as I feel like going back to Jantar Mantar, Meet Pannalal, live the experience called Jantar Mantar again. I wished Jantar Mantar had a time machine which would then take us to the time when this was constructed so that we could see what it was that existed in the minds of those intelligent brains that made this landmark in Indian monuments.</p>

Developed all-around a lake and surrounded by forested hills, it really is an oasis that attracts large crowds of visitors fleeing the scorching summer sun for cooler climes.

Several well-known temples are also located here and amongst all of them the intricate Dilwara temples are the most beautiful. The scenic panorama, an array of coniferous bushes, flowering shrubs, pretty lakes and also the cool local weather is in this kind of contrast for the arid environs from the desert state of Rajasthan that MNT Abu gets even much more of the novelty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of the many architectural wonders that line the corners of Jaipur, the Nahargarh Fort has carved a special place for itself. Located just a few kilometers away from Jaigarh Fort, the Nahargarh Fort has its own story to tell.</p>
<p>This fort is located quite near to the main area of the pink city. All you have to do is take a car or taxi or even an auto from the best hotel in Jaipur where you will be staying, tell the driver where you want to go and he will take you there!<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2703" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nahargarh-Fort.jpg" alt="Nahargarh Fort" width="741" height="486" /><br />
There are various reasons that make Nahargarh an interesting place to explore. There are many facts about this place, which hardly any tourist knows about. Let’s take a look at some of the most interesting and intriguing facts about this piece of architectural brilliance:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Nahargarh Fort is almost 700 ft tall!</li>
<li>The main purpose behind building this fort was that it would protect the main area of the city in case of a siege. However, after this, the city had never faced any siege!</li>
<li>The Nahargarh Fort was built in order to protect the city. So naturally, it was filled with arms and ammunitions. However, since they never got a chance to use these fire arms, they were used to mark time! Instead of a bell that announced the time to the city, gunfire worked as the signal.</li>
<li>Okay so the main part of this fort is the Madhavendra Bhawan. This place is what can be termed as the chambers for all the numerous queens that the king had. There are a total of 12 chambers in this region, where each of which is connected. Beautiful frescos and paintings adorn the walls of these chambers and the passageways. However, the chambers are designed and connected in such a way so that no queen would ever find, in whose chamber the king decided to spend some time! This was done in order not to promote jealousy amongst the 12 queens, each of who vied for the king’s attention.</li>
<li>Since the walls of this fort are beautiful and have born the test of time quite gracefully, it is a place where a number of popular Bollywood films have been shot.</li>
<li>Sawai Ram Singh was the King of Jaipur during the 1857 revolt. Since the kings had already signed a pact with the British to ensure their stability, many British officers were sent to Nahargarh Fort to protect them from the danger of the mutineers, which up till then had almost all the facilities that a good hotel in Jaipur would have had.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from these really interesting anecdotes about the fort, here’s a little story about how the fort came to be named:</p>
<p>It was Sawai Jai Singh, who had commissioned the construction of this massive structure. Supposedly the land on which he was building this fort was of Nahar Singh Bhomia’s whose spirit hampered the work! It was only when Jai Singh promised to name the fort after Nahar Singh that these disturbances stopped.</p>
<p>Legends and anecdotes combined, Nahargarh does make for an excellent place to visit when you travel to Jaipur.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The various historical tourist destinations in the state of Rajasthan are always a charm for the people who want to become a temporary inhabitant of any such site. The very thought of being in a place where a lot of events that we read about in history books can also be quite exciting. To cater to the requirements of such tourists, the abandoned forts are restored and maintained by the authorities who ensure that the present and future generations are able to connect with the history of mankind by being there and not just reading about the same in the books. Lohagarh Fort of Rajasthan, which was once a bustling fort during the occupation of various rulers, is now maintained as a site where the tourists can feel the essence of the old times.</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong></p>
<p>The Lohagarh Fort is located in the city of Bharatpur.</p>
<h3><strong>History</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-8525 alignright" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Lohagarh-Fort.jpg" alt="Lohagarh Fort" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>The name of the fort is derived from Loha, meaning iron. True to its name, the fort was impregnable and was built to endure any sort of attack by the enemies. The Jat rulers of Bharatpur are credited with the construction of this fort. The deep moats surrounding the fort were filled with water during the occupancy of any ruler, thus making it immune against any type of enemy attacks.</p>
<p>The construction of the fort began in 1732 under the reign of Maharaja Suraj Mal of the Jat Dynasty and ended around sixty years later. A distinguishing characteristic of the fort is that its outer walls are very thick. The mud used in these walls was able to stop the cannons fired by the enemies and launch the same to attack back. The construction of these walls, measuring as long as seven kilometers in length, took eight years.</p>
<p>The entrance to this fort is through the Ashtadhatu Gate, which translates to eight metals, the primary constituents of this huge gate. The gate depicts the elephants marching during the war. This gate was first installed at the Fort of Chittorgarh and was taken to  Gaya Bihar by Alauddin Khilji after he attacked the Rajput rulers when Jats attacked  Gaya Bihar and brought the gate to be installed in this fort in 1764. Similarly, the gate installed to the south of the fort named as Charbhuja was also brought from  Gaya Bihar.</p>
<p>The fort was attacked in 1805 by the British forces that made numerous attempts to enter the fort in a span of six weeks. Despite losing 6000 soldiers and trying out every possible tactic, the British forces withdrew the army.</p>
<h3><strong>Structure</strong></h3>
<p>Unlike other forts that were heavily decorated, the Lohagarh Fort was exempted of any additional adornments that reflected the wealth, preferences, and religious inclination of the rulers. The Jat rulers wanted their forts to be built in a simple manner, with emphasis on functionality and safety.</p>
<p>Except for the meeting hall and a few residential chambers, there are no traces of decoration in the entire fort, a symbol of a simple life that Jat rulers used to believe in. Murals of elephants can be seen at the gate which is quite simple and has faded away with time.</p>
<h3><strong>What to See</strong></h3>
<p>Within the fort premises, there are you places named as Kamra Palace, Mahal Khas, and Palace of Badan Singh. Other monuments in the fort include the Kishori Mahal, Moti Mahal, Kothi Khas, Fateh Burj and Jawahar Burj.</p>
<p>A museum was established in the Kamra Palace and meeting hall in 1944. Inside this museum, you will find a wide collection of sculptures found during the excavation, with few of them dating back to the second century. These sculptures, along with other objects, were found near the fort and in neighboring villages. A statue of Lord Shiva, depicting his avatar of a cosmic dancer along with a Shivlinga, enhances the beauty of the museum collections. In the museum’s art gallery, a few portraits of the Jat Kings and other rulers of Bharatpur, along with miniature paintings are worth looking.</p>
<p>The armory section of the museum showcases the guns and other weapons used by the armies in the ancient period. The Jawahar Burj, a tower built to commemorate the victory of Maharaja Suraj Mal over the Mughals, stands tall within a rampart at the fort. The coronation ceremony was also held in this tower. Another prominent tower within the fort is the Fateh Burj that was built again by Suraj Mal to commemorate his victory over the Britishers. It also served as a watch tower for the rulers. The Vijay Stambha or the Victory Column, an iron pillar inside the palace, is inscribed with the lineage of the Jat royal family.</p>
<p>The Ganga Mandir built in 1845 was among the last additions made to the fort. The king who was looking after the construction instructed that all the people working for the state must donate one month’s salary and any increments they receive in the salary towards the construction of this temple. Laxman Mandir is another brilliant example of architectural detailing. The ceilings, walls, pillars, and arches of this temple enhance the beauty of the structure. Nehru Park, a garden located between the entrance and the museum complex, is a perfect place to relax with your companions or alone after exploring the fort.</p>
<h3><strong>Eat, Drink, Collect</strong></h3>
<p>The Madhuban Cafe is a place where you can have snacks, meals, and non-alcoholic beverages. In the city, there are a lot of restaurants and roadside vendors where local delicacies and other cuisines are available throughout the day.</p>
<p>Tourists can opt to stay at Shagun Guest House, where the prices are relatively low than many modern hotels and lodges. Those who are looking for a more posh option for staying can head to the Swaraj Resorts, where along with lodging and food, you will get a pool, Wi-Fi service, garden and a multi-cuisine restaurant and bar.</p>
<h4><strong>Best Time to Visit</strong></h4>
<p>The museum opens and 10:00 am and closes down by 04:30 pm. It is closed on Mondays. To make the most of your trip, it is advised that you plan your visit to this fort during the months of October through March, as the weather is cool and exploring the vastness of the fort and other places in the city becomes easy. Summers in the city can be harsh with the mercury soaring up to 45 degrees, which might force you to remain within the confines of your hotel room, rather than enhancing your senses with the view that this city has to offer.</p>
<h4><strong>How to Reach</strong></h4>
<p>The closest airport to Bharatpur is in Agra, at a distance of approximately 54 kilometres. Other airports close to the city are in Agra, Jaipur, and  Gaya Bihar, at a distance of 174 and 1823 kilometers respectively. From these destinations, public transportation and private vehicles are available in plenty. Tourists can reach to Bharatpur by boarding one of the many trains that connect this historical city to the neighboring cities and other states such as West Bengal, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, etc.</p>
<p>Bharatpur is connected to the city of Jaipur through National Highway 11 and with  Gaya Bihar through National Highway 2. The state-run buses make it easier for the tourists to reach Bharatpur and explore the city and market area apart from the fort.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A visit to a National Park takes one backwards in time, to eons when humans treaded in harmony with the rhythms of Mother Nature. The difference an intimate life with the nature makes to the quality of one’s life has to be experienced to be known. Poets romanticize the sagas of their beautiful trysts with nature’s mysteries; painters immortalize the myriad hues of its magic in their portraits; nature lovers from all walks of life find their hearts opening to receive the offerings of the sky-high trees, the cacophony of chirping birds and the desolate longing of lone wilderness. Whomever you wish to get to close to &#8211; Mother Earth, your own soul, or even God &#8211; Nature offers the easiest passport to your destination. A visit to Keoladeo National Park which boasts of an astonishing array of plants, animals and birds as part of its ecosystem in the Indian state of Rajasthan is no exception. One might know it by its rather popular previous name as Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary. As its old name suggests, the park is most known for its staggering diversity of birds, ornithologists have reported about 230 species of birds within the Park premises.</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong></p>
<p>The National Park adorns the city of Bharatpur in Rajasthan.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>A Shiv temple is situated in the midst of its jungles. In fact the park has been named after the same. The park derives its origin to nearly two hundred years ago when the rulers of Bharatpur used it as hunting ground. Later British Viceroys employed the ecologically rich land within the park for the same purpose. It was in 1976 that the Park received its official designation as a bird sanctuary. In 1982, the stature of the park was elevated as a national Park. In 1985, UNESCO declared it as a World Heritage Site.</p>
<p><strong>Geography</strong></p>
<p>The governance and maintenance of the Park rests with Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation. The park sprawls to an area of 29 square kilometers. One third of its land comes under the category of wetlands. The Wetland of the Park is a part of the larger Indo-Gangetic Great plains. It testifies to one of the miracles of Mother Nature to engender such a fecund land in the midst of a largely arid region. In fact, the park is as noteworthy for its diversity of plants as for its wildlife. Of the 379 plant species that grow here, 96 comes under the category of wetland species. Tropical dry deciduous trees along with dry grasslands form its principal vegetation. One can effectively call the park as a fresh water swamp, with its wetland limited to ten sq.km when it is not raining. During monsoon, most of the land within the park is flooded with water levels going up to 2m. The park dries up during the hot summer months.</p>
<p>Macro invertebrates like worms, mollusks, and insects abound the region. This serves their inevitable role in the food-chain feeding the larger animals and birds.  Herons, storks, migrant ducks also find themselves in their ideal habitat within the park premises.  Greater spotted eagle, imperial eagle, short-toed eagle are also easily reported in its skies. Sambars, Indian mongoose, hyenas, civets, jackals etc. form few of the 27 mammal species found within the Park. Of strategic ecological importance are its many species of fishes, as they serve as food for the multitudes of birds within the Park, 43 to be precise, 37 of which enter its premises via water from Ajan Bund while six are its resident breeds. As many as 65 million fishes occupy the park during the monsoon showers. Wildlife catalogues lists about seven species of turtles, seven amphibian species, five lizard species and thirteen snake species within the land.</p>
<p>It is a cause of great disappointment that licentious hunting by nomads has caused the once found Siberian cranes to go extinct in the region. The park allowed access for cattle previously; the practice has been later revoked by the Park authorities. This has lead to fostering of widespread resentment by the local population and even lead to violent clashes in 1982. The government continues its stance on banning although Bombay Natural History Society has advised for letting limited grazing within the park premises. Grazing is known to have certain favorable effects for the ecological balance too, but revoking the law presents legal hurdles for the Government.</p>
<p><strong>What to Do</strong></p>
<p>Bird watching! Bird watching! Bird watching! And, some more! Remember to carry cameras in hand. You would not want to miss recording all the diverse bird species you some across in your tour. Bikes and bicycles are available for hire at the park entrance. One can ride on a boat or hire a Tonga during the monsoons. Prepare to enrich your knowledge of the region with your efficient rickshaw puller acting as a tourist guide too letting you into his treasure-house of information into the land’s topographical features, flora and fauna. The elite opt to indulge in the luxury tickets on the Palace on Wheels, a tourist train service functioning under IRCTC.</p>
<p><strong>Eat, Drink, Collect</strong></p>
<p>One can easily buy food and snacks within the Park premises. There is a canteen at the second gate of the National Park that serves good food. Or else, head to Bharatpur Forest Lodge.</p>
<p>Provision for accommodation can be found at the Bharatpur Forest Lodge, Circuit Office, Dak Bunglow and Shanti Kutir. Many resorts and three star hotels function close enough to the Park premises to cater to the rising tourist population.</p>
<p><strong>Best Time to Visit</strong></p>
<p>The park offers the best of itself during the winters. It is thus ideal to visit the Park in between October-February. The park remains open from sunrise till sunset 365 days of the year. While the Park charges a nominal 25 Rs per person as entry fee for Indian nationals, foreign nationals are charged Rs 200 for access within the Park area.</p>
<p><strong>How to Reach</strong></p>
<p>If by air, one needs to deboard the plane at Agra Airport. It is about 56 kilometers from the Park. For international visits,  Gaya Bihar International Airport would prove the nearest. It is about 184 kilometers from  Gaya Bihar. The railway station at Bharatpur falls on the Mumbai- Gaya Bihar route, thereby being well connected to most Indian cities.</p>
<p>Once you are within the city, you can avail of the many modes of public transport to travel. Do not forget to explore the city by hiring a bicycle; this will save you a lot of time in not having to find your way through congested traffic jams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rajasthan is about palaces, forts, deserts, camels, handicrafts, colorful dresses all fused together in a vibrant culture that does not fail to impress and enchant.</p>
<p>Think of Rajasthan and you conjure up images of royal palaces, magnificent forts and vast stretches of sand. There is mystique in the land of maharajas. Swirling sand storms give way to whirling of voluminous colorful ghagras as folk dancers entertain you and camels undulate serenely across a landscape that reflects history at each turn. You could spend days on end traveling from the city of Lakes, Udaipur, up towards Jaisalmer sitting like a glorious island amid a sea of sand. When you think of a tour, it is not which places to visit but which places to leave out so get set and start with a tour of the most visited places.</p>
<p><strong>01. Jaipur:</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4431" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Hawa-Mahal.jpg" alt="Hawa Mahal" width="700" height="451" /><br />
The pink city, as it is known, was set up by the visionary Raja Jai Singh, and the layout as well as buildings, are proofs of his farsightedness. You may like to stroll in the various bazaars and browse for garments, jewellery and handicrafts but before that you must visit:</p>
<ul>
<li>The City Palace-a huge complex housing small and large structures, the most notable of which are the Chandra Mahal and Mubarak Mahal.</li>
<li>Jantar Mantar, the observatory built by Maharaja Jai Singh II</li>
<li>Jal Mahal Palace located in the center of Man Sagar Lake.</li>
<li>Hawa Mahal, built by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, a wonderful latticed structure where you can actually feel a breeze blowing throughout the day.</li>
<li>Amer Fort, built on a hill at some distance, a world within itself.</li>
<li>Nahargarh Fort, built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, on the Aravalli Hills.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>02. Jodhpur:</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4432" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mehrangarh-Fort.jpg" alt="Mehrangarh Fort" width="700" height="472" /><br />
If Jaipur is the Pink City, Jodhpur is called the Blue City because most buildings are of that color. The second largest city, Jodhpur has its charms, a few of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Mehrangarh Fort, a large complex overlooking the city and home to a museum. You could go zip lining here.</li>
<li>Umaid Bhawan Palace, once the fabulous home of its rulers, it is now partly a heritage hotel.</li>
<li>Rao Jodha Desert Park spread over 70 hectares.</li>
<li>Old city, clock tower, Sadar Market.</li>
<li>Mandore Gardens to view some old architecture, temples and museum.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>03. Bikaner:</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4433" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Junagarh-Fort.jpg" alt="Junagarh Fort" width="700" height="423" /><br />
Bikaner sits in the middle of Rajasthan, founded by Rao Bika in 1486. You could spend a couple of days visiting the temples and palaces but these places you must visit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Junagarh Fort, Laxmi Nivas and Lal Garh Palace should be on your itinerary.</li>
<li>If you like temples visit the Maru Nayak Ji, a Vaishnav Temple, the Laxmi Nath Temple, perhaps the oldest one in the city, the Bhandasar Jain temple, Mukti Dham Temple, Kolayat and the famous Karni Mata Temple, well known for rats.</li>
<li>A camel safari ride is a must and if you visit Bikaner during the Camel Festival, it is truly enjoyable.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>04. Jaisalmer:</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4434" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Golden-City-Fort.jpg" alt="Golden City Fort" width="700" height="458" /><br />
A <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/rajasthan-tour-packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visit to Rajasthan</a> would be incomplete without making the trip to Jaisalmer, the Yellow city, and the obligatory visit to Havelis with finely carved Jharokhas, Jaisalmer Fort on Meru Hill built in yellow sandstone, the Jain temples and Gadsisar Lake.</p>
<p><strong>05. Udaipur:</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3132" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Leela-Udaipur.jpg" alt="The Leela, Udaipur" width="700" height="392" /><br />
The beautiful city, the Venice of India, is also called the City of Lakes and is famed for:</p>
<ul>
<li>City Palace Museum, housing a vast collection of antiques and sculptures</li>
<li>Lake Pichola and Fateh Sagar as well as the Palaces adjoining these Lakes such as Fateh Prakash Palace</li>
<li>Classic Car Museum and Shilpgram village and museum</li>
<li>Kumbhalgarh Fort</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>06. Ranthambore National Park:</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3166" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Ranthambore-National-Park.jpg" alt="Ranthambore National Park" width="700" height="353" /><br />
The Ranthambore National Park is one of the best tourist destinations of Rajasthan. Not only is the Ranthambore National Park host to exotic varieties of flora and fauna but it also houses a gorgeous 10th century Fort that is counted amongst the best historical relics of India.</p>
<ul>
<li>The fort inside Ranthambore Park was coveted by many rulers because of its unique positioning.</li>
<li>About 30 tigers stay in the Ranthambore Park and tourists who want to see the magnificent beast in its natural surroundings flood the park in May to July for tiger spotting.</li>
<li>The main fort of Ranthambore is 3 kms inside the national park. The location of the park is interesting as it is right at the center of Vindhya plateau and Aravalli hills. It can be easily identified by jagged cliffs and rocky ridges.</li>
<li>It’s quite easy to reach Ranthambore national park as its only 4 hours away from Jaipur international airport. The railway station of Sawai Madhopur is only 7 miles away.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>07. Pushkar Camel Fair:</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3165" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pushkar-Camel-Fair.jpg" alt="Pushkar Camel Fair" width="700" height="350" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Pushkar is a small exquisite town of Rajasthan near the Ajmer city that is a well-known spiritual destination and a shopping hub. Every year in the month of November an amazing number of camels come to this tiny town for the annual camel fair in Pushkar.</li>
<li>The Pushkar camel fair was originally introduced in ancient India to act as a meeting ground for camel and cattle tradesmen. The lunar month of Kartika was chosen to host Purnima festival. Gradually the fair took the form a major shopping and religious carnival which attracts tourists from all across the world.</li>
<li>In 2014 the Pushkar Camel Fair is slated to take place from October 30th to 6th of November. The first round of activities will start with the trading of camels and cattle while the focus will settle on games and camel races in the middle of the week. By the end of the week the festival will end up with a religious carnival.</li>
<li>Book your seats early if you want to catch the fair this year. Snake charmers, street magicians, bards, musicians, acrobat performers and dancers add to the attraction of the fair.</li>
<li>According to popular myths a dip in the holy water of the Pushkar Lake during full moon nights will dissolve all sins and purify the soul.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Attractions</strong><br />
Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary, Chittorgarh, Pushkar, Fatehpur for its Shekhawati paintings and dozens of other places beckon you. Make a plan, pick your places and set out.</p>
