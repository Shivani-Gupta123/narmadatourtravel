<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9271" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Natural-Beauty-of-Kaziranga-National-Park.jpg" alt="Natural Beauty of Kaziranga National Park" width="900" height="597" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Natural-Beauty-of-Kaziranga-National-Park.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Natural-Beauty-of-Kaziranga-National-Park-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Natural-Beauty-of-Kaziranga-National-Park-768x509.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Being nestled in the enchanting land of Assam in northeast India, Kaziranga National Park is a world famous tourist destination as much in its natural beauty as it is in its wildlife. Surrounded by some of the most breathtaking tea estates and gardens, the park sits in the abundance of green glory. Spectacular landscapes, soothing environs, pristine horizons and a canopy of refreshing greens closely guard the many treasures the Kaziranga National Park is so famous for. In its natural ambience and unadulterated beauty, the national park is undoubtedly a haven for every nature lover.</p>

<h3><strong>History</strong></h3>
<p>As a prominent tourist attraction, one that resides in great biodiversitical significance, the Kaziranga National Park sure is a happy hunting ground for nature connoisseurs in its present state. But equally significant is the history this global conservation site stems of. A century old park, the Kaziranga National Park came into being in 1905 under the aegis of the then Indian viceroy Lord Curzon and his wife Mary Curzon.</p>
<p>As a site reputed for its one horned rhinoceros even back then, it despaired Mary Curzon that she could not spot a single of the vulnerable species. It was on her insistence that the Viceroy took steps to establish Kaziranga as a protected area that would guard and conserve these dwindling animals. In its unlikely history therefore, the now famous National Park had its modest beginnings as the Kaziranga Proposed Reserve Forest. Apart from its natural endowments therefore, it is also this piece of unusual history that renders the Kaziranga National Park all the more famous a travel destination.</p>

<h3><strong>UNESCO World Heritage Site</strong></h3>
<p>Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985, the Kaziranga National Park is undoubtedly famous in its esteemed standing. From a reserve forest to a wildlife sanctuary and then to a national park, Kaziranga has had a long history of conservation that made it the center of international attraction to naturalists. But perhaps what fetched this natural haven even more attention was its designation as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.</p>
<p>Noted for its unique natural environment, the park represents one of the last unmodified natural areas in the north-eastern region of India. In housing the largest population of the one horned rhinoceros in the world as well as in its many other defining attributes that establish it as one of the finest wildlife refuges in the world, the UNESCO World Heritage Site status granted upon the already world famous park only served to amp its importance in the ecological scene concerning the world.</p>
<h3><strong>Home to the Largest Population of the One Horned Rhinoceroses</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9272" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/One-Horned-Rhinoceroses.jpg" alt="One Horned Rhinoceroses" width="900" height="567" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/One-Horned-Rhinoceroses.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/One-Horned-Rhinoceroses-300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/One-Horned-Rhinoceroses-768x484.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Most famous for its greater one horned rhinoceros, the Kaziranga National Park harbours a singularly significant population of the vulnerable species. In its wholehearted conservation efforts, KNP has been instrumental in saving the then rapidly dwindling numbers of rhinoceros from the brink of extinction at the turn of the 20th century. Hosting two thirds of the second largest living rhinoceros of the world, the park boasts 2413 one-horned rhinos as per the 2018 census. However the park happens to be equally infamous in its numerous instances of rhino poaching.</p>
<h3><strong>Important Bird Area</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9269" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Birds-in-Kaziranga-National-Park.jpg" alt="Birds in Kaziranga National Park" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Birds-in-Kaziranga-National-Park.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Birds-in-Kaziranga-National-Park-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Birds-in-Kaziranga-National-Park-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Not just in its four legged animals, Kaziranga is also as famous a National Park for its avifauna. Recognized as an Important Bird Area by Bird Life International for conservation of avifaunal species, the park is home to a variety of migratory birds as well as resident birds. From rare and threatened species to a large number of common and local birds, abundant flying beauties grace the confines of the world famous park. In its diversive ecology and location at the junction of the Australasia and Indo-Asian flyway, Kaziranga emerges as a rather substantial bird area. The many wetlands of the park play a crucial role for the conservation of globally threatened migratory bird species. As a result of such environment conducive to the winged creatures, the park is home to precisely 479 species of migratory and resident birds, out of which 25 are globally and 21 are locally threatened species.</p>
<h3><strong>Only Habitat of the Eastern Swamp Deer</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9270" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Eastern-Swamp-Deer-in-Kaziranga-National-Park.jpg" alt="Eastern Swamp Deer in Kaziranga National Park" width="900" height="575" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Eastern-Swamp-Deer-in-Kaziranga-National-Park.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Eastern-Swamp-Deer-in-Kaziranga-National-Park-300x192.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Eastern-Swamp-Deer-in-Kaziranga-National-Park-768x491.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>In its largely monopolised focus as being the single largest habitat for the rhinoceros, the Kaziranga National Park however is relatively lesser famous on other equally significant aspects. One such attribute that should make the park more than just a hotbed of the horned animals is its population of the eastern swamp deer. In fact as the only habitat in the world to house this species that are faced with a far more urgent threat than Indiaâ€™s rhinos, tigers or elephants, Kazirangaâ€™s eastern swamp deer do not receive the recognition they deserve. In fact the eastern swamp deer makes up the Big Five hegemony in the park, along with the rhino, Royal Bengal Tiger, Asian elephant and the wild water buffalo.</p>
<p>With just about 1000 individual managing to persist in Kaziranga, the only known natural habitat at present, the species is far more endangered than most of the others that somehow thrive in at least more than a single habitat. Living in the swampy wetlands and grasslands, this critically endangered species though remains lesser known can still lure in more tourists and fame for the Kaziranga National Park.</p>
<h3><strong>Highest Density of Tigers</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9273" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tigers-in-Kaziranga-National-Park.jpg" alt="Tigers in Kaziranga National Park" width="900" height="539" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tigers-in-Kaziranga-National-Park.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tigers-in-Kaziranga-National-Park-300x180.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tigers-in-Kaziranga-National-Park-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>A Tiger Reserve since 2006, Kaziranga National Park is also famous for having the highest density of tigers among protected areas in the world. With 21 tigers per 100 sq km, Kaziranga has also emerged to be one of the few wild breeding areas outside Africa for multiple species of large cats, such as Bengal tigers and leopards.</p>
<h3><strong>Largest Population of the Wild Water Buffalo</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9274" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Wild-Water-Buffalo-in-Kaziranga-National-Park.jpg" alt="Wild Water Buffalo in Kaziranga National Park" width="900" height="507" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Wild-Water-Buffalo-in-Kaziranga-National-Park.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Wild-Water-Buffalo-in-Kaziranga-National-Park-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Wild-Water-Buffalo-in-Kaziranga-National-Park-768x433.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Kaziranga houses also the largest population of the Wild water buffalo anywhere accounting for about 57% of the world population. One of the last strongholds for the species that has been recognised as endangered, Kaziranga houses approximately some 1666 buffaloes. Also inhabiting a couple other national parks and wildlife sanctuaries in the state, the Asiatic buffalo is another of the prime attractions of the Kaziranga National Park.</p>
<h3><strong>Biodiversity Hotspot</strong></h3>
<p>In its massive encompassment of floral and faunal resources, Kaziranga National Park has very often been noted for its spectacular biodiversity. As one of the largest tracts of protected land in the sub-Himalayan belt, the park is significant in being a biodiversity hotspot. More specifically, Kaziranga National Park lies on the edge of the Eastern Himalaya biodiversity hotspot and combines high species diversity and visibility. In its many diversive dominant ecoregions, KNP possesses a biodiversity that is matched by only a few protected areas around the world.</p>
<p>From its semi evergreen forests and frequently flooded grasslands the world famous park rests in such extensive areas of biodiversity that has led it to nurture an amazing number and variety of species in its realm. Apart from its biodiversity treasure with the park, the Kaziranga National Orchid and Biodiversity Park also serves as a further insight into the rich biodiversity manifestation of the region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The national parks of Assam promise wildlife enthusiasts that they will not return disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>Kaziranga National Park</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-8484 alignright" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Kaziranga-National-Park.jpg" alt="Kaziranga National Park" width="300" height="200" /><br />
Along the south bank of the Brahmaputra River is the Kaziranga National Park. The setting is beautiful with the national highway approaching it flanked by tea plantations and the misty Mikir Hills serving as a backdrop.</p>
<p>The famed one-horned rhino, for which this World Heritage Site is famous, provides an abundance of sightings. In fact, during the early morning safari on an elephant, you will see many of them munching on grass serenely and giving you no more importance than a glance. However, when there is a baby around, the magnificent animal can turn aggressive. For all its weight, the â€˜armouredâ€™ animal can run very fast.</p>
<p>The national park, spread over 430 sq km, is arguably one of the best preservation efforts in the country with more than 2,000 rhinos, despite the toll that poaching has taken. The park had a mere 366 rhinos in 1966. Even way back in 1908, Kaziranga was declared a reserve forest with a ban on poaching due to the efforts of Lady Curzon, wife of the then British Viceroy. In 1974, it was officially declared a national park.</p>
<p>Kaziranga pride is the abundance of the one-horned rhino. But it is also a biodiversity hotspot. Dense grasslands, beels (wetlands) and tropical evergreen forest enrich an ecosystem ideal for diverse fauna like elephants, Indian bison, swamp deer, hog deer, sloth bears, tigers, leopard cats, jungle cats, Hoolock gibbons, wild boars, pythons and monitor lizards. It is also a birdwatcherâ€™s haven with a great variety of birds and is regarded as an â€˜important areaâ€™ by Birdlife International.</p>
<p>The park is easily accessible by air (Jorhat), rail and by road from Guwahati or Jorhat. Today, apart from the forest lodge there are also excellent private resorts and guest houses around the area. Jeeps are available for fire too but nothing is more exciting than the elephant rides guided by experienced Forest Department mahouts. The park is closed between mid-April and mid-October.</p>
<p><strong>The Manas National Park</strong></p>
<p>The Manas National Park is also in Assam. Located at the foothills of Bhutan and spread over 2840 sq km, it is a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site, a Project Tiger Reserve, an Elephant Reserve and also a Biosphere Reserve.</p>
<p>The main tourist spot of Mathanguri on the northern flank is situated along the Manas River flowing in from Bhutan. The parkâ€™s lyrical beauty is legendary with sparkling water of the Manas mirroring the blue sky, orange-laden shrubs on the banks and a silence that soothes the city-laden soul in the evening. If you are lucky, on a moonlit night you can even witness herds of deer coming for a drink. Wisely, the park authorities do not allow harsh electric lights or lud music in order to preserve the tranquility of the forest.</p>
<p>Manas is famous for the rare golden langur, the endangered hispid hare and the elusive red panda. Rhinos were abundant too once but political unrest took a toll in between. Recently, two male rhinos were successfully trans-located from Kaziranga. For bird lovers, it is a veritable paradise. Giant hornbills fly in flocks at dawn and sundown. Then there are pheasants, jungle fowls, partridge, and a variety of water birds inhabiting the area. A boat ride on the Manas is an exhilarating experience. The best time to visit here is from November to April.</p>
<p>Even the road leading to Manas at a distance of 176 km from Guwahati will allow you to appreciate the rural beauty of Assam with its thatched huts and bamboo bridges, women in colourful hand-woven clothes catching fish with Jakoi, and the hills at the Himalayan foothills beckoning you. This is after all the land of the Red River, Blue Hills as late poet-writer Hem Barua had described the beauteous valley of Assam.</p>
<p><strong>Amazing Assam</strong></p>
<p>One of the best ways to discover Assam is by taking a cruise, operating on various sections of the Brahmaputra River. Here, one can enjoy the wildlife and scenic landscape of the state.</p>
<p>Nameri National Park at the foothills of the eastern Himalayas is home to the tiger, black bear, elephant and leopard to name a few. Among birds, the endangered white-winged wood duck needs mention.</p>
<p>The Jia Bhoroli River flowing by is famous for the golden Mahseer fish. An annual angling competition is organized here every November. The Eco Camp situated nearby is a popular camping site.</p>
