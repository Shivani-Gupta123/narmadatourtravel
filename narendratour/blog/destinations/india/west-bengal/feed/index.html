										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kolkata, known as Calcutta prior to 2001, is the capital of the West Bengal state in the eastern region of India. Stretching in north-south direction on the eastern bank of the River Hooghly, it usually includes its suburbs along with its 15 million population approximately. This ranks it as the third largest metropolitan city in India and world’s eighth largest agglomeration.</p>
<p>The name of the city actually originates from the name Kalikata, one among the three villages in the area prior to British. In fact, Kalikata comes from Kalakshetra meaning the Land of the Goddess Kali. Located in the Ganges Delta, the city was primarily a stretched marshland that was cultivated over the decades to house the growing population. The remaining wetland is named as East Calcutta Wetlands and is accredited as wetland of international importance.</p>
<p>Until 1911, Kolkata was the capital of India and the centre of advanced education, commerce, science, tradition, and politics in India. However, since 1954, it has been a centre of political aggression and financial stagnation. It is noteworthy for its revolutionary struggle right from the Indian Independence until the trade union movements. The current picture is that its halted growth has received a boom due to Information Technology from 2000.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Explore the land; its art, culture and history; and you will see for yourself why we call it beautiful Bengal for nothing. Leaf on through the post to realize why the diversity puts West Bengal among.</p>
<p><strong>Reaching the City of Joy</strong><br />
There are four entry points to India- Gaya Bihar, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai, though most Western flights make a stop at either  Gaya Bihar or Mumbai. One might land there, and avail of a connecting domestic flight to Kolkata. With the new international terminal however, the city has revamped its international aviation infrastructure to receive flights from abroad too.</p>
<p>You can plan your travel yourself as well as depute you travel agent to do the same. Hotels in Kolkata are many, as you will find out in the following few pages.</p>
<h3><strong>Best Places to Visit</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Kolkata</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6258" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kolkata-City-1024x538.jpg" alt="Kolkata-City" width="840" height="441" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kolkata-City-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kolkata-City-300x158.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kolkata-City-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kolkata-City-170x89.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kolkata-City-370x194.jpg 370w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kolkata-City-780x410.jpg 780w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Kolkata-City.jpg 1200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /><br />
An electric mix of diverse tastes and preference, Kolkata is a truly cosmopolitan place. From the mansions of North Kolkata to high-rises of the South, and from the deep roots of western influence in the Central part of the City of Joy to the distinctly community-based East, the nature of diversity is spread way too deep into the veins of the city. Today, it’s quite amazing to look back some three centuries ago, where wild animals used to strut about in the three villages of Sutanuti, Govindapur and Kalikata, part of the realm of one Sabarna Roy Choudhury. What was one the temple of Chowringhee Nath, today is the busy heart of the City, Chowringhee? Myriad, isn’t it?</p>
<p>As we take you through Kolkata, we reveal a treasure trove for those who have an eye for great architecture. Along with this, a touch of the religio9us movement of yore. In the form of weekend detours in Air-Conditioned buses tracing the trail of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda; this includes trips to Belur Math, Dakshineswar Kali Bari and Swamiji’s ancestral home, to name but a few. The other trip introduces tourists to the architectural wonders of erstwhile Kolkata-Jorasanko Rajbari, Thakurbari, Gokul Mitra’s house, Kumartuli and its artisanville, Sovabazar Rajbari, Marble Palace and quite a few others.

A few mountain rivers stream through the idyllic surroundings which are the habitat for bison, one-horned rhinos, leopards, elephants and many other animals. One can see all of these, at the same time having a clear view of the Himalayas standing tall in the background.</p>
<p><strong>Reaching different shades of green</strong><br />
You can access Dooars through multiple districts on road. Long distance buses ply from Kolkata. Railways connect the Dooars to Siliguri and Kolkata via New Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar.

Among various attractions are the monitor lizards, migratory birds, sharks, crocodiles and of course the Royal Bengal Tiger, for which tourists from all corner of the world throng this place.</p>

Should you choose to reach via Canning, you can board a train from Kolkata to Canning.</p>
<p><strong>Santiniketan</strong><br />
The land of red soil, with tales of literary brilliance in the air, that’s Santiniketan for you. It’s where the river Kopai meanders slowly and lore revolves around the Khowai. In Bengali, it means “The Abode of Peace”. Indeed, that was the only thing on Maharshi Debendranath Tagore’s mind as he set up an Ashram that was made immortal by the Bard of Bengal, Rabindranath Tagore, when he established Viswa Bharati University, a preferred destination for students from across the world.</p>
<p><strong>Bishnupur</strong><br />
Originally christened Mallabhum after the age-old Malla rulers of Bengal, it is the birthplace of an art truly exclusive to this region – the Terracotta. The district capital Bishnupur is strewn with terracotta (burnt earth) structures describing tales from the Vedas and the Gathas. Of course temples throughout the whole district bear testimony to the aesthetics of the artisans, and are highly held by connoisseurs around the world. At present, 22 of Bankura’s 32 well-established temples are being maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India.</p>

<p><strong>Bishnupur</strong><br />
The main railway station is Bankura Town. It’s also a 5 hour drive from Kolkata. You can avail of long-distance buses from Kolkata.</p>
<p><strong>Murshidabad</strong><br />
A treasure trove of history, Murshidabad is intrinsic to memories of the erstwhile Dewan of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, Nawab Murshid Quli Khan. Lalbag, the then capital of Bengal, and the British established city at Berhampore portray two different views in history. Notable tourist spots include Hazarduari, Katra Mosque, tomb of Siraj-ud-Daula and large number of other palaces dating back to about 400 years, like the Madina Mosque, Jahan Kosha, Khosbag, Motijhil, Kiriteshwari temple, Kathgola Palace, Nizamat Imambara to name but a few. The Wasef Manzil, Jagat Seth’s house, Bacchawali Cannon, Nimakharam Deuri, Karna Suvarna and the fields of Plassey continue to enthrall tourists from all corners of the world. A 30-minute drive across the river can take you to the ruins of Karnasubarna, the ancient capital of Bengal.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Places of Interest</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Digha</strong><br />
A bemused Warren Hastings referred Digha as ‘Brighton of the East’. Every year millions of people throng Digha, for its beautiful coastline, along with a spectacular sunrise and sunset view. Of late, it’s the most popular sea retreat of West Bengal.</p>
<p><strong>Mandarmani</strong><br />
The 13 km long beach of Mandarmani is the home of serenity and solitude. Some reputed hoteliers have set up their resorts, yet leaving the magic of this place intact and have made it more of a weekend retreat for tourists from Kolkata and its adjoining area.</p>
<p><strong>Coochbehar</strong><br />
The erstwhile princely state of Coochbehar came under the Indian jurisdiction in 1949 but its royal legend goes on, with imposing palaces (Rajbari), temples (Madan Mohan and Baneshwar Shiva Temple) and celebrated personalities like Rajmata Gayatri Devi of Jaipur, who hails from the Coochbehar royal family. In short, the city of Cooch Behar is ideal for the travelers who have an eye for history and Bengal’s eventful past.</p>
<p><strong>Malda</strong><br />
The erstwhile seat of power of Bengal is famous for its delicious mangoes, hand-woven coten and silk textiles along with the relics of the Hindu, Muslim and Buddhist regimes.</p>
<p><strong>Mayapur</strong><br />
The birthplace of Chaitanya is the most pious place for Bengali Vaishnavas. It is also the headquarters of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKON). The ISKON’S Chandrodaya Mandir is one of the most important pilgrim destinations for Vaishnavites all over the world.</p>
<h4><strong>Art and Crafts</strong></h4>
<p>Each of soil, sponge-wood (shoal), cotton, jute, silk, handmade paper, bell metal and cane is indigenous to Bengal. So are their usages in Bengali livelihood. Terracotta, pottery, shoal-work, Patachitra painting, bell-metalwork, cane-work, hand-woven textiles (Sari), embroidery on light quilts, to name but a few and most worthy of mention is the fact that each of these handicrafts has been given the status of exquisite folk –art by generations of specialist artisans. Today the finesse of Krishnanagar clay dolls, distinct form of terracotta horse of Bankura, Dokra artifacts of tribal craftsmen and patachitra of Kalighat in Kolkata have garnered recognition from the world over.</p>
<p>In modern times, Abanindranath Tagore, Rabindranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose and many others established the Bengal School of Painting and other fine arts during the 19th and 20th centuries. As time passed by, the tradition of excellence in art was followed by the names like Atul Bose, Jamini Roy, Debi Prasad Raychaudhuri, Hemen Majumdar, Zainul Abedin, Nirad Majumdar, Abani Sen and Gobardhan Ash. In recent times Kolkata emerged as a prominent trading center with the stalwarts Ganesh Pyne, Jogen Chowdhury and Subhaprasanna, all joining with their own bit in the fray.</p>
<h4><strong>Culture and Festivals</strong></h4>
<p>It is said to be a land of 13 festivals in 12 months. And the biggest among these carnivals is Durga Puja. Scriptures say that it marks the goddess Durga’s homecoming on earth. The four days of Puja are celebrated in a manner that has few parallels in the world! Spectacular Pandals, illuminated streets and millions of people treading miles for Pandal hopping – are all specific to this festival that ends with immersion of the earthen Durga idol. It is one of the largest carnivals of the earth attracting millions of people to Kolkata and Bengal.</p>
<p>Besides Durga Puja, Bengalis celebrate Dol (festivals of colors), Rash (mainly at Mayapur), Dipabali (festival of light), Nababarsha (Bengali new-year) and Christmas with high enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The colorful cultural gamut of Bengal, includes various folk dance forms, Chhau is a masked folk dance form from Purulia district that has achieved more international acclaim over others like Natua, Raibenshey and Tusu.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although it is the tiger that attracts most visitors to the Sunderbans National Park, it biological diversity is one of the main reasons why UNESCO ascribed it as a World Heritage Site in 1987.</p>
<p>The Sunderbans, which takes its name from the once abundant sundari trees, sprawls over a huge deltaic zone – an archipelago of mangrove-riddled islands and a network of tidal rivers and creeks. India shares the Sundarbans with Bangladesh, and together it is the largest mangrove forest in the world. Of the 4,264 sq. km of mangrove forest that lies in India (wholly in West Bengal), 2,585 sq. km has been earmarked as the tiger reserve under Project Tiger. Apart from this, the Sunderbans is a National Park (1984) and a Biosphere Reserve (1989).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-8487 alignright" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Sundarbans-National-Park.jpg" alt="Sundarbans National Park" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Today, there are several entry points into the Sundarbans, lying within a radius of 45 km to 100 km, south and south-east of Kolkata. But whether you enter through Canning (the nearest suburban railway station) or any other town, ultimately you have to take the water way. Although there is limited accommodation on land (a state tourism lodge and a handful of privately run resort-style units), one can also opt for launch cruises run by the State Tourism Department and private operators.</p>
<p>The Sunderbans is very different from any other forest in India. Apart from the inhabited islands, tourists are allowed to disembark only at specific islands, albeit with permission and accompanied by armed forest guards, to visit the watch towers. From the watch tower, people get a closer look at the thick forest canopy. It is not difficult to catch a sight of spotted deer, wild boar or monkeys near the waterholes but it is well-nigh impossible to spot a tiger. The Sajnekhali Island has a watch tower and a Mangrove Interpretation Center where visitors can learn about the unique biodiversity of the region.</p>
<p>A typical trip to the Sunderbans involves an exciting cruise along tidal rivers like the Matla or the numerous creeks. Cormorants, curlews, fishing eagle or kingfishers keep you company from time to time. The log on the mudflat that you had ignored could just be a crocodile! Tides are a common feature here and the animals have also learned to adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>Although one has to be extremely lucky to see a tiger here (it has the ability to merge with the russet brown vegetation), people have been rewarded with sights of tigers along the mud banks (craftily negotiating the spiky roots), or swimming across the channels. The proximity of man and wild animals makes life difficult for both, as they fight for living space and food. It is important to note that tigers here are not habitual man-eaters. The closeness has familiarized tigers with human beings. With more honey and wood gatherers, and attacks from poachers, the tiger is already fighting a losing battle. “Visitors to Sunderbans should not pin their hopes only on seeing a tiger,” remarks Tilottama Das, a former State Tourist official and a veteran guide of the region, “instead they must enjoy the unique environment and the relaxing cruise. If they get to see the tiger, they must consider it as a bonus.” As they say in the Sunderbans, ‘the tiger is always watching you, even if you may not see it.’</p>
<p><strong>A Word of Advice</strong></p>
<p>The best time to visit Sunderbans is between November and March. Most package tour operators take care of the compulsory entry permits and forest guard arrangements.</p>
<p>The modest government tourist lodge (in Sajnekhali Island) and a few private accommodation options are heavily booked during the peak tourist season, so advance planning is advisable.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to carry essentials such as a torch and batteries, sunglasses, umbrella, insect/mosquito repellents and personal medicine.</p>
