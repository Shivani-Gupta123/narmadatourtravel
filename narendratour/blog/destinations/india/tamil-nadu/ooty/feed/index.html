Located in the Nilgiri hills, it is at the height of 7,500 feet above the sea level. Officially, it is named as Udhagamandalam.</p>
<p>It is not clear as to how the name Ootacamund was derived, however ‘mund’ refers to the Badaga word for a Toda village.

<p>The British governor of Coimbatore, John Sullivan, was pleased with this town’s climate. Therefore, he bought the land from the local inhabitants (Kota/Kotas, Toda, Kurumba, and Badaga); at a cost of few feasts.</p>
