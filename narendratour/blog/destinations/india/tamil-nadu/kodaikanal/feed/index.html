										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kodaikanal is a cool town in the hills of the Dindigul district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. In the Tamil language, the name of the city means The Gift of the Forest; while in Malayalam, it means The Princess of Hill stations. Above the upper Palani hills, the town is atop the plateau at 2133 m between the Parappar and Gundar valley. The core of the town holds an irregular basin whose heart is the manmade Kodaikanal Lake.</p>
<p>While the meadows and grasslands occupy the hill, huge Eucalyptus trees, Shola forests, lofty rocks, descending rivulets, cascading waterfalls, flower beds, and ever-present gardens thrive in the valleys. To the town’s north, high sloping hills act as guards, while to its east, the hills simply slope into lower Palnis. To the west, a plateau leads to the Indira Gandhi National Park, Annamalai hills, Manjampatti Valley, and the main part of the Western Ghats.</p>
<p>Established in 1845, it is a refuge for the tropical, arid plains of the region. Hospitality and tourism run the economy here. Kodaikanal is full of churches and Hindu temples holding religious significance.</p>
<h3><strong>Tourists’ Attractions</strong></h3>

Situated at 500 m from the bus stand and erected in 1863, an artificial, star-shaped lake attracts locals and tourists. You can hire rowboats and pedalos at the Kodaikanal Boat Club.
