										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Enchanting Waterfalls in Tamil Nadu</strong></p>
<p>Tamilnadu, a South Indian state is a house to beautiful destinations. Tamilnadu is not only a place with ancient temples, exciting hill stations and wildlife parks, but houses at least half a dozen waterfalls. To the north west of the state lies Hogenakkal, a chain of waterfalls feeding a wild stream. And to the Deep South lies the world-famous chain of Courtallam. In between and beyond, lie several other beautiful falls including Agasthiyar, Thirparappu and Kumbakkarai.</p>
<p>If you are willing to tour South India, it is not at all a bad idea to dedicate about three days to visit waterfalls across Tamil Nadu. You could plan your itinerary in such a way that you not only miss these waterfalls but visit other places of tourist importance as well.</p>
<p><strong>Hogenakkal Chain of Falls, Smoky Niagara of India</strong><br />
<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3732" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Hogenakkal-Falls.jpg" alt="Hogenakkal Falls" width="700" height="400" /><br />
Exciting Coracle Ride Followed By Roasted Fist</p>
<p>Hogenakkal is a majestic chain of waterfalls to the northwest of Tamil Nadu near the border of Karnataka. The place has a rocky landscape which gives rise to a kind of smoke (effect caused by water sprinkled into air) when water hits the rocks. In local language, Hogenakkal means smoke emanating from rocks.</p>
<p>This place is a well-known tourist spot in the South India. A must do thing for tourists here is to take up a coracle ride down the wild stream bordered on both sides by rocks intersected by many small waterfalls. The level of adventure depends upon the level of risk you are willing to take and level of confidence the boatman has in you. This is because of the heterogeneous nature of the stream with different levels of calmness of water at different places. Only upon your willingness, the boatmen would take you through some of the dangerously adventurous parts of the stream. For example, he could take you underneath a fall but would stop at just enough distance so that you will be spared by wild mother nature.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon to feel tired after a wild coracle ride. To soothe you from inside out, there are shops selling delicious roasted fish.</p>
<p>Though Hogenakkal is in the state of Tamil Nadu, it is easily reachable from Bangalore airport of Karnataka state. The place is at about 150 Kms from Bangalore international airport.</p>
<p><strong>Courtallam, Natural Spa Amidst Hillocks</strong></p>
<p>Enjoy De-Stressing Bath Deep South Amidst Greenish Hillocks</p>
<p>Ancient civilizations both in Egypt or India, had one thing in common. Almost every city had a large common public bath place. There are remains even today. But on the other hand there are very few places like Courtallam which don&#8217;t need a mammoth construction to be termed a great bath. Called Natural Spa, this place does immense credit to its name. With over half a dozen falls scattered throughout the town that is surrounded by hillocks, Courtallam is a definite place to enjoy a deeply relaxing bath.</p>
<p>Similar to Hogenakkal, this place has a chain of waterfalls. But unlike Hogenakkal, Courtallam doesn&#8217;t feature a wild stream but a calm one that is harmless. Hence, this place might not be as adventurous as Hogenakkal but is an ultimate destination to relax inside out.</p>
<p>Prominent falls in Courtallam include Shenbaga Devi, Main falls, Old Kutralam falls, Thenaruvi and AIndharuvi. Every waterfall is little far away from each other which requires you to drive back and forth. Without a local tourist guide or a swift navigational mind, you could be in trouble in finding routes.</p>
<p>Though every fall has its own specialty, Aintharuvi requires a special mentioning. It is a group of five falls adjacent to each other. In fact, Aintharuvi means five falls in Tamil. The proximity of this place to the local bus station makes it a crowded place for most of the year. But still itâ€™s a good place to visit and enjoy.</p>
<p>The waterfall named &#8216;Main falls&#8217; at the middle of the town is very popular. It is a gigantic one with water falling from above 50 feet.</p>
<p>For those who love to lead a peaceful and pure life then honey falls or Thenaruvi is for them. However, it is quite difficult to access this place due to which apart from its mesmerizing beauty the place is less crowded. Access is not by distance but by difficulty in getting there. Yes, you have to trek few kilometers before reaching this spot. The sight and feel of this waterfall is a wonderful reward for your hard trekking.</p>
<p>Courtallam is situated at about 200Kms from Madurai Airport. But this is a domestic airport. Alternatively, you could reach Courtallam from Trivandrum international airport.</p>
<p><strong>Thirparappu Waterfalls, 7-month rainfall from rocks</strong><br />
<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3733" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Thirparappu-Waterfalls.jpg" alt="Thirparappu Waterfalls" width="700" height="400" /><br />
The mesmerizing flow of water on God&#8217;s own country&#8217;s border</p>
<p>If you are interested in touring South India, there is least probability that you have not heard about Kerala (called God&#8217;s own country for its unbelievable natural resources). Tamil Nadu state shares border with Kerala. Located at border slightly into Tamil Nadu&#8217;s side is Thirparappu waterfalls.</p>
<p>Road to Thirparappu falls from Nagercoil of Tamilnadu is to be enjoyed in same proportion as that of the waterfall itself. Greenfields on either side of the road intercepted by small towns is a journey that will be remembered and recollected by you even after years. Assuring you of a nostalgic feel, the road takes you to the falls with water flowing seamlessly like a glittering white sheet.</p>
<p>Unlike Hogenakkal and Courtallam, this is not a waterfall chain but alone and beautiful waterfall falling from a flat-topped rock. The height is about 50 feet. This is a seasonal waterfall with good flow of water for at least 7 months in a year.</p>
<p>Though the place is famous for its waterfall, the true highlight is the beautiful downstream with paddy fields on both sides. You may or may not visit the falls, but not taking time to walk along the stream or through the fields is a great miss.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chennai is the capital city of Tamil Nadu state in India and this lens would briefly touch upon the travel attractions in Chennai. Since this city has been my home for the last two decades, I could easily list the places of interest in Chennai.</p>
<p>The city has many travel attractions in the form of beaches, open parks and many theme parks. Vedanthangal bird sanctuary is located at around 80 km from Chennai. Vandalur Zoological Park is one of the best maintained parks that houses a large number of animal species. The city also boasts of a couple of forests, Guindy national park and the Nanmangalam reserve forest.</p>
<p>Marina, Elliots, Uthandi and Thiruvanmiyur are some of the well known beaches in Chennai. The city is a busy metropolis with a young working class mushrooming the roads in the peak hour traffic. The city is known for its busy shopping activities in the T Nagar area. People from all over India and abroad throng the busy streets of T Nagar for shopping.</p>
<p>This city has a strong linkage to the colonial past as it was developed mainly during the British era. Many of the old buildings constructed during the British regime stands today as a reminder of the distant past. This city has a long rainy season that starts from June and goes on till December. The copious rains and the beautiful beaches must have attracted the British.</p>
<p>There are plenty of good hotels like Taj Connemara, Taj Fisherman&#8217;s Cove, Hyatt, Hilton and Residency Towers.</p>
<h3><strong>Vandalur Zoo in Chennai</strong></h3>
<p>Arignar Anna Zoological Park is a Zoological garden located in Vandalur spread over 602 hectares. Since it is located on the outskirts, it can be reached within an hour&#8217;s drive from the heart of city.</p>
<p>Though the Vandalur zoo was opened on 1985, it did not have a good green cover initially. I remember visiting Vandalur Zoo long back and it was a bit of struggle spending time there in the hot conditions without adequate tree cover. If I was not able to cope up with the heat, imagine the plight of poor animals. But things have changed for the better since then.</p>
<p>I have visited Vandalur zoo several times in the last ten years and it is a green oasis in the middle of the city. The place resembles a dense jungle and I feel that the animals look lot more healthy now compared to earlier times. I like visiting the park in the first half of the day as the heat will build up in the second half. There is a restaurant run by TTDC (Tamil Nadu tourism development corporation) and we get mostly south Indian food only.</p>
<p>Whenever I visit, I like to take the tour of the park in a battery-operated vehicle and also go on a lion safari. It would take a full day to cover the park by walk. But being on our foot for that long could be a bit strenuous and I opt for the tour on a battery operated vehicle. Other than the lions elephants and tigers, the park boasts of a very diverse animal population that includes zebras, giraffe, white tiger (shown in picture), bison, hippopotamus and many more.</p>
<p>I like this zoological park primarily because they have taken maximum care to create a natural ambiance for the animals. The wild animals are housed in large enough areas for them not to feel caged. The image shown above was shot by me during one of my visit and I am glad that this almost looked like a good wildlife photography.</p>
<h3><strong>Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3717" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vedanthangal-Bird-Sanctuary.jpg" alt="Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary" width="900" height="500" /></p>
<p>Vedanthangal bird sanctuary is a protected area located in Chennai-Trichy highway shortly after Chengalpattu. It takes about ninety minutes of drive to reach Vedanthangal from Chennai. The major part of the drive is on the national highway but the last stretch is on a narrow village road. Since the village road is well maintained, driving through the countryside is a pleasurable experience.</p>
<p>The sanctuary is a very small one and the walking area provided for tourists is also very short. There is good car parking space available and the place can be reached by buses too. There are no major restaurants here and so one should plan the breakfast or lunch stopover on the way. We get stuff like tender coconuts, snacks and ice cream in the stalls located near the entrance. Some of the stalls disappear on less crowded days.</p>
<p>This is a seasonal spot as it can be visited only between November and February. The monsoon rains need to fill the lake here and then only the migratory birds will flock in thousands. If there is a severe monsoon failure that leaves the lake dry, then the migratory birds would not visit here. I wonder how these birds get the information about whether the lake is full or not. Do they check internet or get a mobile update?</p>
<p>As I understand, the water in the lake serves two purposes. One, it serves as good source of food for the visiting birds with a large fish population. Two, it also offers the much needed protection to the birds during their nesting season by submerging the trees and keeping the predatory animals like wild cats at bay.</p>
<p>I am not so much into bird watching but what drives me here is my love for nature. I understand there are many bird species like pelicans, herons, cranes and storks. I cannot differentiate one from the other. But I love watching the beauty of this winged creature. I would advise the bird watching enthusiasts to carry a telescope or a pair of binoculars as there are very many viewpoints available to get a closer look of birds.</p>
<h3><strong>Marina Beach in Chennai</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3715" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Marina-Beach-Chennai.jpg" alt="Marina Beach, Chennai" width="900" height="500" /></p>
<p>Chennai prides itself by having some of the best beaches. Marina is the city&#8217;s most popular beach. It is located closer to the heart of city in the areas of Triplicane and Santhome. Marina beach is heavily crowded during the evenings. It is a favorite place for the morning walkers. The walkers start thronging the place as early as 5.00 AM and this is the first sign that the city is gearing up for a new day.</p>
<p>In the evenings, the road abetting the beach has heavy traffic but the beach offers solace to the residents from the heat during the day. Sea breeze would set in usually by afternoon and so the beaches are pleasant in the early evening even on hot summer days. The waves are high and there are plenty of people who stand by the shore to cool their heels against the crashing waves.</p>
<p>Taking bath in the sea is not allowed in any of the other beaches in Chennai. The Bay of Bengal sea has an unpredictable nature with strong underwater currents. This current could drown some of the best swimmers at times. So I would advise anyone to refrain from swimming in the Chennai Sea as safety is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>I love the walks in the evenings having an ice cream or a snack like noodles. The Chilli Bajji (Milagai Bajji as it is known in Tamil) and the fish fry are two special attractions of Marina beach and you would find many stalls selling such items. Marina beach also boasts of a large area for parking cars and two wheelers. It is well connected by buses and metro rail.</p>
<p>Elliots beach in Besant Nagar is another popular place which is also very crowded these days. The crowd is usually younger here compared to Marina. There are also beaches in Thiruanmiyur and Uthandi. The one at Uthandi is one of the least crowded. The picture shown above was taken at Thiruvanmiyur beach during a rainy day.</p>
<h3><strong>Guindy National Park, Chennai</strong></h3>
<p>Guindy national park is one of the smallest national park of India. The small size of the park is understandable as it is located right in the middle of Chennai city. The Guindy national park is located in and around IIT, Raj Bhavan (the Governor&#8217;s abode) and the children&#8217;s park. Since it is a protected area, the public may not be able to access the restricted areas of the park. However, the children&#8217;s park located on the northern side of the park is open to public.</p>
<p>The children&#8217;s park and the adjoining snake park let people to have a look at the park from the periphery. Despite its small size, the place looks noticeably more pleasant and cooler than the rest of the city. The drop in temperature inside the park is around 5 degree Celsius as compared to rest of the city. This is what good greenery and nature can help achieve. I wish we have retained nature the same way in other places as well.</p>
<p>The main attraction of the park is the presence of a large number of deer in the main forest area. Some of the deer stray often into neighboring areas and can be easily spotted around IIT, Children&#8217;s park or even Guindy Engineering College. When I spotted the deer for the first time in this area, I was really surprised that mankind has allowed such a beautiful animal to thrive in the middle of a city in natural setting.</p>
<p>The Children&#8217;s park can be visited anytime between 9 AM and 6 PM. It has a large children&#8217;s play area and has a reasonably good number of animals and birds. But we do not get to see the big cats here. There is a dense tree cover inside and so I always find this place very pleasant irrespective of how the rest of city feels.</p>
<p>Snake Park is open to public from 9 AM to 5.30 PM. The staff there sometimes gives useful lectures and demonstrations to children and general public. There is one fact that I have learnt there I would not forget for a long time. Only about ten percent of the snakes that we see outside are venomous. So next time when you see a snake, you do not have to run if you know whether it belongs to the 90% side or 10% side.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kodaikanal is a cool town in the hills of the Dindigul district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. In the Tamil language, the name of the city means The Gift of the Forest; while in Malayalam, it means The Princess of Hill stations. Above the upper Palani hills, the town is atop the plateau at 2133 m between the Parappar and Gundar valley. The core of the town holds an irregular basin whose heart is the manmade Kodaikanal Lake.</p>
<p>While the meadows and grasslands occupy the hill, huge Eucalyptus trees, Shola forests, lofty rocks, descending rivulets, cascading waterfalls, flower beds, and ever-present gardens thrive in the valleys. To the townâ€™s north, high sloping hills act as guards, while to its east, the hills simply slope into lower Palnis. To the west, a plateau leads to the Indira Gandhi National Park, Annamalai hills, Manjampatti Valley, and the main part of the Western Ghats.</p>
<p>Established in 1845, it is a refuge for the tropical, arid plains of the region. Hospitality and tourism run the economy here. Kodaikanal is full of churches and Hindu temples holding religious significance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tamil Nadu, the jewel of South India is replete with many visit-able destinations that would fascinate the heart and soul of any passionate vacationer. There are temples, wildlife resorts and many other places to keep you busy on your Tamil Nadu vacation. To plan the best Tamil Nadu holiday, read on to learn about the top 20 visit-worthy places of Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>Tamil Nadu is the cultural capital of the South, known for its temples, for being a stronghold of traditions that have endured since centuries, for being home to exquisite temples, beaches and for its hill stations. People here are warm and welcoming and the cuisine reflects traditions and festivals, a celebration of life in a holistic way. Whereas Hinduism may have been toned by external influenced farther up North, there are pockets in Tamil Nadu where Sanskrit and the original rituals are still maintained the way they were practiced hundreds of years ago. Tamil Nadu is said to have been inhabited since well over 10000 years but it is the Chola, Pallava and Pandya rulers who created carved temples, followed by the Vijayanagar influences. The British took over and have left landmarks of their culture, adding to the spicy mix that is Tamil Nadu today.</p>
<p><strong>Your Options</strong><br />
If you plan to visit Tamil Nadu always spare plenty of time or make specific plans to visit specific destinations. You could plan to visit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temples of Tamil Nadu</li>
<li>Hill Stations of Tamil Nadu</li>
<li>Visit Tamil Nadu in time to partake in festivals such as Pongal, Mamallapuram dance festival, Arubathimoovar Festival or any popular festival</li>
<li>Since Tamil Nadu is known for its modern healthcare facilities you might want to go in for treatment and then take in a few sights</li>
</ul>
<p>For the best all-round experiences Plan Tamil Nadu Holidays that take you to some of the better temples, to hill stations and to beaches.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Chennai</strong></h3>
<p>Chennai is the capital, a port city, the center of commerce and also an arts and cultural centre so what better way to start your South India trip. Chennai is a mix of Hindu traditions and Christian influences. You can visit the Marina beach and have a lovely time and then take in the St. Maryâ€™s Church and Santhome Cathedral Basilica. Chennai is also home to Swami Vivekananda House. From Chennai, you can take short excursions to the Pulicat Lake and then onwards to Mamallapuram with its beautiful 8th-century monuments. For amusement and entertainment, you have the MGM Dizzee World, the VGP Golden Beach, Queens Land, Dash and Splash to keep you and your children engrossed.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Cuddalore</strong></h3>
<p>Cuddalore boasts of one of the finest golden beaches where you can indulge in various activities and have a wonderful time with your family. Porto Novo is another place of interest where you can go visit the Portuguese Fort and then have some fun at the Samiyarpettai Beach. For the religiously inclined, Cuddalore offers Bhuvanagiri, Padaleeswarar Temple, the ancient Vriddhagiriswarar Temple at Virudhachalam and Devanatha Swamy Temple.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Chidambaram</strong></h3>
<p>Your Tamil Nadu Sightseeing tour must include Chidambaram, home to the ancient temple built by the Cholas. There is a temple to Lord Shiva where, instead of the usual lingam, one sees a statue of the Lord and the temple complex, spread over 40 acres, and also houses a Lord Nataraja idol in the kanakasabha, the roof of the sanctorum being covered with gold foil. Chidambaram is also of special interest to devotees of Bharatanatyam since the eastern gopuram of the temple complex has 108 carvings depicting various poses of the dance form. You also have the Kali temple here. Sirkazhi is about 20 km and is the birthplace of Thirugnana sambandar with a Shiva temple dedicated to him. Nagore is home to the dargah of Hazrat Meera Sultan Syed Shahabdul Hameed and the fossil wood park at Thiruvakkarai is also worth a visit.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Dharmapuri</strong></h3>
<p>For nature lovers Dharmapuri offers a number of attractions in the form of water falls, the most striking of which is the Hogenakkal Falls located about 46 km away, close to the border of Karnataka. Another place worth visiting is Theerthamalai, 16 km from Harur and this is not only a religious spot with a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva but the beautiful springs around the temple make it an ideal picnic spot.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Courtallam</strong></h3>
<p>If the Hogenakkal falls have whetted your appetite, then go on to Courtallam in Tirunelveli in the Western Ghats region where the rivers Chittar, Manimuthar, Pachaiyar and Tamiraparani create numerous waterfalls as they meander onwards to the sea. While some falls can only be seen during and just after the rains, the area is even otherwise a place of enchanting beauty with a mix of mountains, wooded slopes and water bodies. The main waterfalls worth a visit are the Peraruvi, the largest at 60 metres and the Chitraruvi, somewhat smaller. However, in terms of striking visual beauty the Aintharuvi or five falls takes the cake and is visited by hundreds of tourists. The two other falls worth a visit are the old courtallam falls and the Puli Aruvi or Tiger falls. Courtallam is also famous for an ancient temple of Lord Shiva. Kasi Viswanathar temple is another famous Siva temple about 6 km from another equally famous Courtallam Dakshinamoorthy temple in Puliyarai.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Kanchipuram</strong></h3>
<p>Kanchipuram is temple town and is about 75 km from Chennai. At one time it is said this place had over a thousand temples and even today, it is a pilgrimage spot. Kanchipuram is also famously known for its silk sarees. The temples to visit are the Kailasanathar temple the Varadaraja Perumal temple, the Vaikuntha Perumal temple and Ashtabhuja Perumal temple. Ekambareswarar Temple is magnificent, rising high into the sky while the Kamakshi Amman temple, with a pond is about serenity. There is plenty more to see in Kanchipuram by way of temples and your Tamil Nadu tourism expert should be able to give you the right guidance about time to spend here.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Erode</strong></h3>
<p>It is a given that wherever you go in Tamil Nadu, you will come across temples ancient and modern. It is no different in Erode where you have the Bannari Mariamman temple, one of the famous Shakti temples and also the Kondathu Kaliamman temple and the Bhavani Sangameswarar temple. The last one is located at the confluence of three rivers and has equal religious significance. As for sightseeing you can go to Kodiveri dam, a picturesque location about 65 km from Erode.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Kanyakumari</strong></h3>
<p>Kanyakumari is famous for being the southernmost tip of India where three seas meet and it is also a place of religious significance with the Kumariamman temple attracting thousands of devotees. Apart from temples Kanyakumari also has the Kamaraj Memorial and Gandhi Memorial as places worth a visit. Then you might take excursions to Suchindram for a visit to the Thanumalayan Temple, go on to St Xavierâ€™s Church in Kottar in Nagercoil and visit the Udayagiri Fort and Padmanabhapuram Palace, 45 km from Kanyakumari.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Kodaikanal</strong></h3>
<p>Visiting one temple after another can be tiring so take a break and refresh yourselves at Kodaikanal, one of the enchanting resorts in South India. Kodaikanal has everything in the right mix: rocks, wooded slopes, mountains, water bodies, meadows and tall trees. Places you must visit are the 24 hectare Lake, Bryantâ€™s park, Coakerâ€™s Walk and the Pillar Rocks.</p>
<h3><strong>10. Yercaud</strong></h3>
<p>Yercaud may not be as famous as Kodaikanal but has a charm and beauty of its own. It is cool and has groves of citrus trees and coffee plantations. While here you must take a walk to the Lake, to Kiliyur Falls to Kaveri Peak and to Arthurâ€™s seat.</p>
<h3><strong>11. Krishnagiri</strong></h3>
<p>Another place of natural beauty, Krishnagiri has its own set of ponds, waterfalls, lakes, hills and valleys. The place is said to be named after Krishnadevaraya and this is where Dr C Rajagopalachari was born. There are three Dams here: Pambar Dam, Kelevarapalli Dam and Krishnagiri Dam with gardens adjoining the spots.</p>
<h3><strong>12. Ooty or Udhagamandalam</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2011" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Emerald-Lake-Ooty.jpg" alt="Emerald Lake Ooty" width="700" height="393" /></p>
<p>Ooty is the queen of hill stations of the South. The weather is always pleasant and cool throughout the year and the region is dotted with tea and coffee plantations. From here you can explore the charms of Nilgiris, ride in the toy train and also visit Coonoor and Kotagiri hill resorts.Â  Ooty itself, with its Government Botanical gardens, the rose Garden and Lake Park are enough to keep you pleasant occupied. Take a walk through the Deer Park and go boating on the Lake after which you can consider trips to the Doddabetta and Pykara Lake, Kalhatti Falls and Water Falls.</p>
<h3><strong>13. Madurai</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1337" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Vandiyur-Mariamman-Teppakulam.jpg" alt="Vandiyur Mariamman Teppakulam" width="700" height="412" /></p>
<p>Madurai may not be as famous as Chennai is today but it is important in its own right, dating back to the 4th century or even before. Madurai is the repository of Dravidian culture, home to countless temples and is today a flourishing industrial city, especially textiles and the Chungidi sarees. There are dozens of temples here but the Sri Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple should be on your list of places to visit during your Tamil Nadu sightseeing tour. The wonderful thing about this temple is the hall of thousand pillars, each one elaborately and ornately carved. Madurai, one must not forget, was also home to kings and the Thirumalai Nayak Mahal is an impressive structure inspired by Indian and European styles of architecture, a lasting legacy of King Thirumalai Nayak. Close to Madurai you will find Srivilliputhur temple, the Palani Temple and Thiruparankundram temple. For some change you can go on to the Suruli waterfalls and make time to visit the Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary at Thekkady.</p>
<h3><strong>14. Mamallapuram</strong></h3>
<p>Once a famous port, Mamallapuram today is silent yet one of the most outstanding testimonials the carving ability of the artisans of the Pallava times. The best time to visit Mamallapuram is December-January when the place comes alive for the classical dance festival, an international event. However, even otherwise, you can visit the rock cut temple caves, peek into the Sea Shell Museum and do the rounds of the Five Rathas, the shore temple and admire Krishnaâ€™s butterball.Â  Be sure to visit the Crocodile bank where you can see crocodiles and other natural fauna.</p>
<h3><strong>15. Namakkal</strong></h3>
<p>For devotees of Shiva, Namakkal has special significance because it has Tiruchengode, one of the seven Shiva Sthalams. Kolli Hills, at a distance of 45 km from Namakkal are famous for the collection of medicinal plants.</p>
<h3><strong>16. Rameshwaram</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1318" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pamban-Bridge-Rameshwaram.jpg" alt="Pamban Bridge Rameshwaram" width="700" height="417" /></p>
<p>Rameshwaram is a tiny island in the Gulf of Munnar but it is home to one of the most magnificent temples with one of the longest corridors to be found in any temple. There are 22 tiny wells around the temple, said to be of religious importance. In addition to the temple, Rameshwaram boasts of beaches at Dhanushkodi, Pamban and Olaikuda, site to lovely coral reefs. The other temples you might want to visit are the Saatchi Hanuman Temple the Jada Theertham, Nambu Nayagiamman temple and the Badrakaliamman temple.</p>
<h3><strong>17. Salem</strong></h3>
<p>Though Salem may be an industrial city today, it does have its charms such as the Mettur dam surrounded by beautiful parks and the Tharamangalam Kailasanathar temple.</p>
<h3><strong>18. Thanjavur</strong></h3>
<p>Thanjavur is a must visit place during your Tamil Nadu Holidays. This is where the Chola Kings flourished and it is also the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu. However, Thanjavur is better known for its Brihadeeswarar temple, its paintings, musical instruments and art plates. The magnificent Sri Brihadeeswarar temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is beautifully carved. The temple is World Heritage Monument and reflects the magnificence of the Palace about 1 KM away. Do not miss the Saraswathi Mahal Library, one of the oldest libraries in the world. Thanjavur has quite a lot to offer by way of Royal Museum, The Serfoji Memorial Hall, the Sharajah Madi, all forming part of the temple complex.</p>
<h3><strong>19. Tiruchirappalli</strong></h3>
<p>Located on the banks of the Kaveri, Tiruchirappalli was once the bastion of the Chola rulers followed by the Pallavas and Pandyas later on. However, it was the Nayaks who really created the city and left behind a rich legacy for us to admire. They were followed by the Muslims, Marathas, French and the British. Today Tiruchirapalli shows influences of all the past rulers with an exotic collection of Forts, churches, temples and a cultural flavor of its own. Undoubtedly it is the Rock Fort that, standing on a tall rock, that will claim your attention. The fort is a landmark but the rock itself lays claim to pride for being the oldest in the world at 3800 million years of age. At the top of the rock are remnants of the Fort and there is a Lord Vinayaka temple. A short distance away you will come upon the Marundeeswarar Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. Only 7 km from here you will visit the famous Srirangam temple, one of the most magnificent in south India with 21 gopurams and a height of 72 metres. In and around the city you can visit the grand Anicut dam, Vayalur where you have Lord Muruga temple, Samayapuram for the temple dedicated to Goddess Mariamman, Puliancholai forest, Lourdes Church, the Nadirsha Dargah and Pachamalai.</p>
<h3><strong>20. Chettinad</strong></h3>
<p>Chettinad is a world within a world. Once ruled by the Chettiars who left behind the magnificent Chettinad House showcasing the heritage and art of that period, this part of Tamil Nadu has its own distinctive lifestyle reflected in the art and the foods. Sample the cuisine and visit the Chettinad House and it will be an unforgettable experience. From here to Karaikudi is a short distance and you will surely love the Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple dedicated to Lord Shiva but with as many as 108 statues of Ganpati? Go on to Nagercoil because this is where the people of Chettinad settled and this forms a continuation of their culture highlighted in the Ilayathangudi Temple, about 25 km from Karaikudi.Â  If you have time you can go on to visit Vairavanpatti Temple, Soorakudi Temple, Velankudi and Iraniyur temple, all in the neighborhood of Karaikudi.</p>
<p>People from the North have a very dim view of the culture of South India. However, a visit to Tamil Nadu shows the essence of pure Hinduism at its most magnificent, untouched by Mughal, Turk or any other influences.</p>
<p>There is plenty more in Tamil Nadu such as Velankanni where your prayers are answered; Vellore, a royal city with timeless carvings and Theni, natureâ€™s bounty for man. Go on a <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/south-india-tour">South India Trip</a> and your <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/tamil-nadu-tour-packages">Tamil Nadu Holidays</a> will prove not only entertaining but also educational. You will return with more knowledge and awareness of the past glories of India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Discover architectural opulence at its best with the heritage trail of the great living Chola temples in Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>The train reaches Thanjavur in the hour before sunrise. Itâ€™s the hour of the Gods. The very air seems to resonate with the sounds of worship even as great flocks of birds call to each other as they fly across the rich riverine delta known as the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3075" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chola-Temples.jpg" alt="Chola Temples" width="741" height="486" /><br />
This is the land that was once home to the magnificent Chola Temples dynasty. In the early years of the 10the century A.D. under the patronage of the Chola emperor Raja Raja Chola 1 the Great (985-1014) it was an empire that shone like the Sun itself, rising in the East and spreading its rays in every direction. From its ports great argosies of ships left for other parts of South Asia taking with them ideas of kingship based on cultural and religious themes that found their manifestation in architectural marvels caved out of stone that took different forms in their new homes.</p>
<p>This is what makes the grand Chola Temples that Raja Raja Chola I built at Thanjavur such a piece of living history. Itâ€™s a compendium of all the arts of sculpture, painting, architecture, as well as the allied ones of music, dance, jewellery, textiles and bronze casting for the marking of idols and temple vessels for there used to be a thousand and more temple dancers who regularly performed the daily ritual of worship at the Brihadeshwara temple of Thanjavur in its heyday. Itâ€™s also an engineering marvel of its time. Of course, today we tend not to notice the imposing height and enormous capstone that crown Raja rajaâ€™s edifice or mountain of dressing and carved stone because verticality or gravity-defying buildings are no longer an issue. Whatâ€™s striking is the exquisite attention to detail. You stare into the dark niches that surround the inner walls of the temple and come face to face with marvelous bronze statues. Many of these have been relocated to the Thanjavur Art Gallery attached to the Thanjavur Palace. You climb into the inner corridors that have been created around the base of the main tower and come upon magnificent wall painting the illuminate the glory of the King-Emperor or explain episodes in the lives of the Gods and Goddesses who live in the temple. There are other corridors in which the varieties of dance poses and their mudras (hand gestures) are enumerated, perhaps for a quick reference by the celebrated temple, dancers. In those still, dark, spaces illuminated with a mere torch, with the scent of camphor, sandalwood oil and jasmine seeping through the crevices of the main sanctum, you can almost feel the presence of Raja Raja Chola himself. He was just one amongst a great family of builders. He set the trend amongst his immediate family so that there are tributes in stone built by and for personalities like Sembiyan Mahadevi, the wife of his grand-uncle Gandaraditya Chola that entices the visitor with their languid grace and immense beauty.</p>
<p>Those who are fortunate enough to follow in the trail of the Cholas, after visiting the Temple of Brihadeshwara, take the road to Gangaikonda Cholapuram. The name signifies that Raja Raja Cholaâ€™s son Rajendra Chola I (1012-1044) a great conqueror and strategist had marched his troops all the way up to the Ganges and brought the sacred water down to his capital in the Trichy district â€“ creating his own version of a Shiva temple that is also called Brihadeshwara. Itâ€™s not quite as grand as the first, but the enormous figures carved in their separate niches, some of which are said to be of the king to venture into other lands with his armies. His influence can be traced to Sri Lanka, Burma, Cambodia, Thailand and the kingdom of Srivijaya in what are now part of the Malaysian peninsula and some of the major islands that make up Indonesia. The smaller, but still exquisite temple at Darasuram built by Raja Raja Chola II (1146-1173) us full of finely carved pieces of sculpture in polished black stone that forms a striking contrast to the granite of the niches surrounding the main structure. The main porch incorporates the suggestion of a chariot pulling the temple forward as in the style of the Konark Sun Temple.</p>
<p>The contact with these different cultures meant a great flowering of ideas between the rulers of the Chola Empire and their distant neighbors. It lingers in the most tantalizing of ways in the telling of legends that speak of merchants and princes being shipwrecked in stage lands only to be rescued by princesses that are described as belonging to exotic tribes, quite often referred to as Nagas, or of textile traditions surviving through the centuries in certain motifs and weaves, or more dramatically in the temples that are still to be seen carved in dreaming spires enclosing any number of different gods and their representatives, the God-kings on earth.</p>
<p>At such moments it seems as if the golden age of Raja Raja Chola I continue to spread its radiance.</p>
<h3><strong>The Wonders of Tamil Nadu</strong></h3>
<p>The capital city of Chennai is home to Fort St. George, Marina Beach, and Guindy National Park. The spiritually inclined can visit the Kapaleeshwarar temple, Parthasarathy temple and the San Thomas Basilica.</p>
<p>When in Kanyakumari, one can enjoy the beautiful sunrise and sunset from the Sangam (confluence of the Bay of Bengal, Indian Ocean, and the Arabian Sea). The Vivekananda Rock Memorial and the adjoining temple are the main tourist attraction here.</p>
<p>Udhagamandalam formerly known as Ooty is one of Indiaâ€™s most famous hill stations. The botanical garden, St. Stephenâ€™s Church and the Government Museum are places of interest here.</p>
