As Muki means pardon in Hindi Language, Ranmukteshwar temple is known among the devotees for holding powers to absolve all the sins of a pilgrim. People come here for a holy darshan and seek blessings from the lord for the absolving of their sins. Usually, the pilgrims offer raw gram pulses here to the main deity. They believe by offering this they can absolve all the debts that are unpaid and can thus lead a peaceful and stress-free life. They also offer the Chana dal for peace of their departed souls.

When you begin to count the most important of the shrines in Madhya Pradesh, Kedareshwar Temple has to top the list for sure. Built in the 11th century, this temple is a great attraction for those entire international and national tourists that visit the state. A lot of people travel all the way to this temple in order to seek blessings of the lord for a better fortune and prosperous life. Basically, it is the holy aura and divinity of the temple that attracts so many tourist and pilgrims towards this temple. When any special event is held, like any significant festival is celebrated, pilgrims in large numbers flock to the temple. From flowers to money, they offer a lot along with their prayers to the main presiding deity of the temple. I am believed that whoever comes to the temple always gets the wish fulfilled. Though the wish may come true a little late, it is always catered to, locals believe.</p>
<p><strong>Mamleshwar Temple, Omkareshwar</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3631" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Mamleshwar-Temple.jpg" alt="Mamleshwar Temple" width="700" height="407" /><br />
Mamleshwar Temple is a very famous holy shrine that sees a lot of devotees flocking to it all throughout the year. The temple lies in the town of Omkareshwar and is very popular. The specialty of the temple lays in its attractively carved pillars and stone works. The temple is believed to inspire a lot of devotees with the absolute divinity that it offers. Devoted to Lord Shiva, this temples sanctum is decorated with a very beautiful Shiva Lingam. This is made of sand. Just like other temples of Lord Shiva, the sacred bull, Nandi, guards the temple sanctorum. A very interesting feature of the temple is that it is always full of monkeys who roam around freely in the premises. They are very rarely seen to attack the devotees, that too only after thorough provocation. During the celebrations of the Maha Shivratri festival, the temple precincts are overcrowded with devotees who stay here all night just to mark the grandeur of the day.</p>
<p><strong>Omkar Mandhata Temple, Omkareshwar</strong><br />
Considered amongst the most revered shrines of the town, Omkar Mandhata Temple is the one that houses one of the 12 jyotirlingas of India. Standing prettily in the confluence of river Kaveri and Narmada, this temple showcases the best of Nagara style of architecture. There are lovely carvings and frescos that are witness to it. The beautifully constructed balconies of the temple have engraved columns having distinct shapes. This gives the temple a very dazzling and elegant appeal. Though the main presiding deity of the temple is Lord Shiva, but idols of Lord Ganesha and Goddess Annapurna are also dominant here. People believe that this temple has special powers and thus the one who comes to pray here never goes empty handed. The devotees find a special kind of peace here and throng to the temple on special occasion in large numbers. Shivratri is celebrated with a lot of pomp here.</p>
<h3><strong>Scenic</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Sacred Meeting Point, Omkareshwar</strong><br />
When it comes to sanctity, each place in India is full of it. But when you are in the city of Omkareshwar, the Sacred Meeting Point is a must visit. River Narmada is the daughter of God Shiva as per mythological beliefs and holds a great religious significance for Hindus. This very sacred river also found its distinct place in various Puranas whereby it is narrated as a holy dip. It is also believed that the circumvention of the river fetches salvation. Though it flows through many regions, when the river reaches Omkareshwar, it merges with river Kaveri to form one island. Now, this meeting point of the rivers gains an amount of significance that cannot be described so easily. It is shaped like the symbol Om, the most respectable and revered symbol of Hindus. Apart from having a religious merit, this place is also bestowed with many breathtaking and mesmerizing types of scenery along with vivid avian life.</p>

<p><strong>Bhopal</strong></p>
<p>Bhopal is the capital of the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Bhopal is also known as the Lake City for it consists of a number of natural lakes. Bhopal is one of the greeniest cities of India. The city bears several historical monuments. In fact, the old city has a happy blending of Hindu and Islamic culture tradition and modernity. Bhopal has a Master Control Facility to control the movements of satellites, the second such installation in the country established by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) in 2005.</p>
<p><strong>Madhya Pradesh</strong></p>
<p>Madhya Pradesh is the central province of India and is the second largest state in India after Rajasthan (it was the largest till the year2000 when Chhattisgarh was carved out of it). Madhya Pradesh borders Uttar Pradesh in the north, Chhattisgarh in the east, Maharashtra in the south and Gujarat and Rajasthan in the west.</p>
<h3><strong>History</strong></h3>
<p>The city of Bhopal was founded by Paramar king Raja Bhoj of the 11th century AD. The city was originally called ‘Bhoja pal’ after Bhoj and the pal (dam to form lakes surrounding the city). The high days of the city, however, declined with the fall of the Paramaras and the subsequent pillage and plundering.</p>
<p>In early 18th century after the last vestiges of the Mughal Empire collapsed, an Afghan soldier from Orakzai tribe called Dost Mohammad Khan laid out the city newly. He also brought Islamic influence on the culture and architecture of the new city. Later, Dost Mohammad met Queen Kamalapati and went on to establish his hold over the entire region. Bhopal survived Maratha onslaught in the late 18th century and finally signed a peace treaty with the British in 1818.</p>
<p>From 1819-1926, Bhopal was ruled by four women rulers. Qudsia Begum was the first female ruler of modern-day Bhopal, succeeded by Sikandari Begum, followed by Shah Jehan Begum (she was labeled as the ‘First Lady of India’ by the British) and finally Kai Khusrau Jahan Begum was the last female ruler. The Begums said to have started development works in the city in the form of waterworks, railways and postal system. Bhopal was among the last princely states to have signed the Instrument of Accession during the time of India’s independence in 1947. Bhopal joined the Indian Union in May 1949. After independence, Sindhi refugees from Pakistan were accommodated in western suburbs of Bhopal. According to the States Reorganization Act of 1956, Bhopal state was included in the state of Madhya Pradesh and was made its capital.</p>
<h3><strong>Geography</strong></h3>

Bhopal consists of several hills including the Idgah and Shyamla hills in the north and Arera hills in the south. Bhopal has two big lakes called the Upper Lake and the Lower Lake (locally called bada talab and Chota Talab, respectively). The Upper Lake drains into Kola River. The two lakes are separated by an overbridge.</p>

<p>The climate of Bhopal is humid subtropical. Winters are mild and dry while summers are hot. Late October to late march is the winter while summer extends from late-March till June. May is the peak of the summer with the mercury rising to beyond 40 degrees while January is the coldest month. The monsoon starts in late June and continues till September.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Khajuraho, the famous temple town of Madhya Pradesh pulls tourists not only from different corners of the nation but from different corners of the globe as well. The Khajuraho temple is a rare artistic and architectural masterpiece and has been awarded the title of ‘world heritage site’. The erotic sculptures on the temple show an artist’s creative frenzy and wild passion at full play. If you wish to enjoy this marvel, you must embark on a tour to Khajuraho at least once. This travel information guide below will provide you all the necessary info.</p>
<h3><strong>History</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Khajuraho.jpg" alt="Khajuraho - Khajuraho Travel Guide" width="700" height="450" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7287" /></p>
<p>Khajuraho retains a special glory amongst the best known World heritage sites of India. The temples of Khajuraho are amongst the most stunning historical monuments of India. It’s estimated that these temples were all built by the Chandela rulers between the periods 900 AD to 1130. The Chandela Rulers were earlier known as Bargujar Rajputs who were Shiva worshipers. Khajuraho was the capital of Chandel kingdom and it remained the cultural capital even after Mahoba was appointed as capital later. This period was the epitome of the Chandela rule and each ruler had at least one temple to his credit. Broadly speaking, temple building was a custom amongst the Chandela rulers and almost all other rulers of the Chandela Clan.</p>
<p>The first temple of Khajuraho is believed to have been built (according to literary accounts by Abu Rehan al Beruni in AD 1022 and the Arab Scholar Ibn Battuta) around 1000 AD. Khajuraho town was the religious capital of Khajuraho. There was a huge wall with 8 inbuilt gates surrounding Khajuraho and each gate was flanked by two fully grown date trees. It was because of the date (Khajur) trees that the place got its name as Khajur Vahika. Alternatively Khajuraho was also known as Jejakabhukti.</p>
<p>After the Chandela dynasty fell from power post 1150 the temples of Khajuraho were disfigured badly by Muslim invaders and they suffered destruction. Local people were forced to leave Khajuraho because of the ruthless attack of Muslims. Historical lore says that the local townsfolk decided that if they left the town then invaders would spare the sanctity of the temples. Thus from the 13th century to 18th century the temples of Khajuraho remained under dense forest cover shielded away from eyes of the world before being discovered by British Engineer T.S Burt.</p>
<h3><strong>Culture</strong></h3>
<p>Temples of Khajuraho have prominent posters in the Tourist Office of India and they have also been depicted in the temple grounds. Many famous dancers and musicians have given recitals with the famous Khajuraho temples in the background. However Khajuraho has mostly claimed the limelight because of the constructs of sexuality that feature in the temple architecture. The sheer fluidity of the lines and the eroticism of the figures have been referred to as an example of the liberal attitude of India. Gays and Lesbians have often cited Khajuraho as the epitome of expressions of sexual freedom.</p>
<p>Some scholars opine that the erotic statues of Khajuraho are often interpreted as sexual intercourse positions between divine beings, gods and goddesses. The temples that have such carvings and sculptures stand at some distance from the cluster of Jain temples and Hindu temples. The outer wall sculptures demonstrate the life style of common members of the society during the medieval age.</p>
<p>10th Century famous poetic and literary work like Karpuramanjari, Kavyamimansa, Prabodhacandrodaya etc are represented thematically in the sculptures of Khajuraho. Other interesting iconography includes Vrik Vyala (fusion of lion and wolf) and Gaja Vyala (fusion of lion and elephant).  The stories about temple architecture abound in the small town of Khajuraho and are expressed by locals through their art and craft.</p>
<p>Khajuraho is a town steeped in rich history and culture and fabric of social life here is fascinating. The population of Khajuraho is not high and the economy of the town is dependent on the tourism activities that center on monuments and temples of Khajuraho. The local folks here still follow the village lifestyle and are deeply religious.</p>
