										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>God’s own country- that’s what <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/kerala">Kerala</a> has always been. Naturally, a land so pretty that it beckons even the heavens into its premises deserves a capital city that is no less charming and exquisite. And Trivandrum is the place that remains steeped in pride in being the capital of this really magnificent of all states in India. Thiruvananthapuram or Trivandrum is as exotic a <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/kerala-tourist-attractions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tourist destination as Kerala</a> itself, earning it the epithet of the Evergreen City of India.</p>
<p>Indeed, residing in the plethora of natural wonders as it does, Trivandrum is no lesser a haven than the state it ‘capitalises on’. But even as a prime tourist destination, Trivandrum still harbours places that remain rare, in that they are less known names and lesser explored destinations. Here’s a list of rare places to visit in Trivandrum so that you dare to venture on the road less taken on your next Kerala travel sojourn-</p>
<h3><strong>1- Shanghumukham Beach</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 8 km from Trivandrum city.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Free.</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open 24/7 (best during daylight).</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 15–20 min drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Sunset/sunrise, Sagarakanyaka sculpture, peaceful beach walks.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9591" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shanghumukham-Beach.jpg" alt="Shanghumukham Beach" width="900" height="551" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shanghumukham-Beach.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shanghumukham-Beach-300x184.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shanghumukham-Beach-768x470.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>While the entire expanse of Kerala abounds in beaches that make for really famous tourist destinations, it’s indeed a surprise that a sandy expanse as definitive as the Shanghumukham beach in Trivandrum remains only a rare phenomenon when it comes to being one of the must visit places with the typical touristry appeal. In its white sands and exclusivity, the beach really is a splendid place to be in- one where you can remain unfazed by the bustle of life as well as the clamour of existence.</p>
<p>An exquisite shoreline, vistas of serenity, beholding sunrise views and impeccable sunset experiences, there is no wonder of nature that Shanghumukham beach does not delight its visitors with. A very striking presence in this picturesque, isolated beach is an exemplary mermaid- the Sagarakanyaka &#8211; sculpted by renowned Indian sculptor Kanayi Kunhiraman. Also an exclusive location of the Arattu festival, the spectacular beach is undoubtedly a prime presence in the capital region of Kerala.</p>
<h3><strong>2- Poovar</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 30 km south of Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Free (boat rides extra).</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 1-hour drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Boat rides, visit floating cottages, explore beaches.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9590" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Poovar-Backwaters.jpg" alt="Poovar Backwaters" width="900" height="511" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Poovar-Backwaters.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Poovar-Backwaters-300x170.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Poovar-Backwaters-768x436.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Poovar might be a tourist town in Trivandrum but it still remains among the rare places to visit given that it sits at a very southernmost point of the district. The magnificent beach that Poovar houses however is relatively well known. With its stunning natural beauty complemented perfectly by the pleasant weather, Poovar should make for a really ideal holiday detour. A pretty coastal village, more accurately an island, the view from Poovar encompasses the mighty Neyyar river confluencing into the vast expanse of the Arabian Sea. Naturally with the sea at sway, Poovar also sports a luxurious beach along the trails of its coconut palms lined glorious sands.</p>
<p>The rustic charm of Poovar complements perfectly the growing luxury appeal of its many star rated establishments, thereby presenting tourists with a delightful mix of the pristine and the pure, the elegant and the mesmerising. There’s diverse flora and fauna at play, while even the seemingly ordinary sights are no less spectacular; coconut groves, fishermen going about their chores, floating cottages- all present a picture of a heaven hitherto undiscovered. There’s even an alluring estuary nearby Poovar that remains resplendent also in the same relaxing vibe and natural abundance. In its yet unspoilt confines, Poovar harbours an aura that caters to every touristry desire- of the quaint and the peaceful as also of the picturesque and the magical.</p>

<h3><strong>3- Neyyar Dam</strong></h3>

<li><strong>Timings</strong>: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM.</li>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9589" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Neyyar-Dam.jpg" alt="Neyyar Dam" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Neyyar-Dam.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Neyyar-Dam-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Neyyar-Dam-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>An idyllic spot for a relaxing day out in the open, the Neyyar dam is a man-made wonder that makes for among the rare places to visit in Trivandrum. In fact, Neyyar is a lake cum dam that is built over the Neyyar River and makes for a really enthralling spot encompassed by the Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary. With the breathtaking Western Ghats as the backdrop, the Neyyar Dam makes for a really amazing picnic place.</p>
<p>The panoramic presence of the lake amidst the majestic standing of the dam makes this place a marvel in many wonders. Undisturbed by the chaos of the world and deep seated in its offering of splendid serenity and unbounded natural bounty, the region makes for a really enchanting place to while away your Trivandrum sojourn. There’s obviously rich flora and diverse fauna inhabiting this ecologically vibrant place. But the Neyyar dam and the surrounding locality also houses many rare medicinal herbs within its offbeat ambit. For visitors to the capital of God’s very own country, this is one rare discovery that will leave you deeply satiated and immensely rejuvenated.</p>
<h3><strong>4- Veli Lake and Tourist Village</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 12 km from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: ₹10–₹20 (boat rides extra).</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 20 min drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Boat rides, floating bridge, photography.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9592" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Veli-Lake.jpg" alt="Veli Lake" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Veli-Lake.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Veli-Lake-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Veli-Lake-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Among the most charming lakes in Kerala yet only a rare tourist attraction, the Veli Lake should certainly be among the list of places you would visit on a <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/trivandrum-tour-packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trip to Trivandrum</a>. Located some 12 kilometers away from the city, the tourist village is a really pretty destination with its locational nestling at the confluence of the Veli Lake and the Arabian Sea. In fact the village sits pretty exotically on the sand bar that separates the two water bodies and oversees therefore the crystal waters of the underlying lagoon.</p>
<p>There’s ample activities that you can indulge in the many waters that define the allure of Veli. In its splendid stretch of backwaters and the lush expanse of its many paddy fields, the scene is one of a breathtaking contrast on canvas. Shades of green as vivid as the strokes of blue define this quaint place that is a visual treat to savor in all its glory. A floating bridge and some amazing stone and grass sculptures further up the exotic quotient of this charming place that definitely is a worthy tourist attraction in all its exquisite offerings.</p>
<h3><strong>5- Kappil Backwater</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 7 km from Varkala.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Free (boat rides extra).</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 20-30 min drive from Varkala.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Walk along the estuary, enjoy sunsets, boat rides.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9587" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kappil-Backwater.jpg" alt="Kappil Backwater" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kappil-Backwater.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kappil-Backwater-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kappil-Backwater-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The Kappil backwaters aren’t exactly among the rare tourist places in Trivandrum but compared to how abundantly explored backwaters in Kerala tend to be, it does not exactly feature as one of the must visit attractions. Situated a mere 7 kilometers away from the very popular beach destination of Varkala, the sheen of the Kappil backwaters seem to remain mired in relative obscurity. In fact the majestic beauty of the backwaters together with the astounding expanse of the sea makes also the Kappil beach a tourist destination of unparalleled magnificence altogether. Amazing sunset and sunrise views further compound the beauty of this place that remains resplendent even in its largely relaxing vibe.</p>
<p>The Kappil Pozhi estuary that separates the sea from the backwaters makes for an amazing walkway, one where you can enjoy a leisurely stroll even as panoramic views and the gentle sea breeze soothes your body and soul. The coconut lined sandy strip makes for such a stunning view that the place remains one of the most photographed across Kerala! Reclusive in its touristry presence yet not in any way lacking in the appeal, hardly would you discover a beauty like Kappil even in your sojourn across the world.</p>
<h3><strong>6- Kowdiar Palace</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: Kowdiar, Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Not open to the public.</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: N/A.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Year-round.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 5 km from the city center.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Admire architecture from outside.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9404" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum.jpg" alt="Kowdiar Palace, Trivandrum" width="900" height="590" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum-768x503.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>That Kerala is mainly celebrated as a land of verdant greenery and swaying waters, of beachy allure and coastal glory perhaps explains why an architectural specimen as striking as the Kowdiar Palace in Trivandrum makes for among the rare places that tourists tend to visit. In its structure, the palace is a simple manifestation of architecture, yet it is by no means any less exemplary a specimen than other flamboyant illustrations. Even historically the Kowdiar Palace holds significance as Maharajah Sree Chithira Thirunal built it for the wedding of his only sister, Maharani Karthika Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi.</p>
<p>A really unique wooden structure, one that even boasts an elevator made of wood, the Kowdiar Palace makes for a grand sight even in its ‘rooted’ existence. A three storeyed building that rears its majestic bearings from among the verdant expanse of Trivandrum, the palace is a lofty sight with its six steeples and an equally breathtaking wonder in the picturesque garden of greenery that nestles it. The Kowdiar Palace indeed is an encompassment of the simplicity that describes Kerala, flamboyant in its natural endowment and alluring even in its minimalism. There truly is no ode to beauty that does Trivandrum better humanly than the Kowdiar Palace.</p>
<h3><strong>7- Azhimala Beach</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: Near Kovalam (25 km from Trivandrum).</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Free.</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Mar.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 30 min drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Beach walks, visit Azhimala Shiva Temple, sunset views.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9585" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Azhimala-Beach.jpg" alt="Azhimala Beach" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Azhimala-Beach.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Azhimala-Beach-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Azhimala-Beach-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Azhimala might be another of the many beaches that dot Kerala but in its quiet splendor it remains one of those rare places that needs to be a feature of the itinerary of every visit to Trivandrum. Just some few kilometers away from the world class appeal of Kovalam, the allure of Azhimala resides in its quaint, calm existence that renders it nothing short of a paradise. The setting is one that is undoubtedly idyllic, the vibe permeating through its serene prettiness speaks of solace and contentment, and in the expanse of almost nothingness would you encounter a peace so alluring that you would want to stay there forever. Of course there are coconut fringed shores that sit pretty daintily with the majestic Azhimala hill as the backdrop. There also is the Azhimala Shiva Temple nearby for you to seek spirituality in, intermingled with solace and tranquility.</p>
<h3><strong>8- Bonacaud</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 40 km from Trivandrum, in the Agasthya Hills.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Free (trekking requires permission).</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 1.5–2 hours drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Trekking, visit tea estate, explore waterfalls.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9586" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bonacaud-Estate.jpg" alt="Bonacaud Estate" width="900" height="518" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bonacaud-Estate.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bonacaud-Estate-300x173.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bonacaud-Estate-768x442.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>A small village hamlet in Trivandrum, Bonacaud is also a really pretty picnic spot. A sprawling encompassment of natural beauty in its array of valleys, waterfalls and hills, Bonacaud also is the lesser known base station of the famous peak, Agasthyarkoodam in the Agasthya hills of the Western Ghats. What however strikes a different tone amidst the abundant beauty and verdance tract that defines every aspect of Kerala and also bonacaud is the presence of supposedly among the most haunted places in the state. That’s a chill that the Bonacaud Bungalow encompasses, that in its misty presence and obscure existence stands very much as a ghostly ground. There also however exists an abandoned tea factory that also adds its own dose of horror to Bonacaud.</p>
<p>Naturally in its abundant peaks and trails, Bonacaud is also a trekker’s paradise. Flora and fauna dot the region as does gurgling streams and crystal waters making it the true encompassment of nature in all its vibrancy. Bonacaud perhaps is no different than any other touristry attractions in Kerala, yet it remains one of the rare places to visit in Trivandrum if you are a soul forever in awe of as much of natural exuberance as the world can grant.</p>
<h3><strong>9- Muthalapozhi</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 29 km from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Mar.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 45 min drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Visit estuary, sunset views, beach walks</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9588" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Muthalapozhi-Port.jpg" alt="Muthalapozhi Port" width="900" height="580" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Muthalapozhi-Port.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Muthalapozhi-Port-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Muthalapozhi-Port-768x495.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>A seaside village that rests just 29 kilometers away from the city of Trivandrum, Muthalapozhi might not strike exactly as a tourist wonder with its seemingly ordinary stature which is why it finds expression as one of the rare places to visit in Trivandrum. But as the place that defines the confluence of the Vamanapuram River and the Arabian Sea, the sleepy hamlet sure is no walkover either. Like all other places that emerge to be prettier with the merge of the backwaters and the sea, Muthalapozhi also is steeped in all of that exquisite beauty. An unending seascape, really stunning sunset views, an array of beach activities and unending allure of serenity- Trivandrum sure couldn’t have got any more ordinarily exotic than this!</p>
<h3><strong>10- Ponmudi</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 60 km northeast of Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 2-hour drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Trekking, visit tea gardens, photography.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9594" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ponmudi.jpg" alt="Ponmudi" width="900" height="519" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ponmudi.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ponmudi-300x173.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ponmudi-768x443.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Ponmudi might be exactly the rarest of places to visit for a tourist, but as a hill station with all the charms it still dwells somewhere in obscurity. A mist covered valley that harbours the robust allure of the teas and also the prettiness of its ample floral diversity, Ponmudi is a really captivating vista of all-encompassing beauty. Sitting conveniently at some 60 kilometers from Trivandrum, Ponmudi definitely is worthy of your visit as among the rare places that has all the elements of making you feel like you are in the midst of true blue paradise.</p>

<h2>History and Mythology</h2>
<p>Kartik Swami Temple is dedicated to Lord Kartikeya, also known as Kartik Murugan Swami in South India. The temple is believed to be the only one of its kind in Uttarakhand dedicated to this deity. According to Hindu mythology, the temple is located at the spot where Lord Kartikeya offered his bones as a testimony of his devotion to Lord Shiva.</p>
<p>The most popular myth associated with Kartikeya is from the Skanda Purana. Once, Lord Shiva challenged his two sons, Kartikeya and Ganesha, to a race around the universe. The winner would earn the right to be worshipped first. Kartikeya set off on his journey around the universe, while Ganesha, in his wisdom, circled around his father, claiming that he was the universe. Pleased with Ganesha&#8217;s intelligence, Lord Shiva awarded him the privilege of being worshipped first, leading to Kartikeya&#8217;s anger and subsequent sacrifice of his flesh and bones in reverence to his father. It is said that the bones of Lord Kartikeya are worshipped in this temple.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The wonder of nature that India as a country is, it is no surprise that each of the states and union territories that shape the landscape and make up her identity have all been equal amalgamations of fascinating diversity with of course the common thread of unity binding them all. From the sparkling waters of the coastal glory that the southern states embody to the magical mirage of glittering beauty characterising the northernmost part of the country, traversing miles of eastern territory sequined in swards and fluent in foliage to arriving at heaps of shining sands and unending unconventionalities of food and cuisine, India is a diverse nation as it can get. But even in its diversity and the unity through which it glides, the country harbours quite a few aberrations that however only sums up the beauty of its benevolent natural bestowing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9451" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi.jpg" alt="Daringbadi" width="900" height="552" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-300x184.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-768x471.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h3><strong>The Allure of Daringbadi</strong></h3>
<p>So while that might mean setting out to astonishingly explore lesser-known <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/underrated-world-heritage-sites-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Heritage Sites</a> or plunging in all in the many paragliding avenues it offers, there also dwells such beckonings that seem quite out of place. That does not however discount even a bit of the bountiful beauty these surprising places seat radiant in with all aplomb. And while any mention of offbeat, lesser explored places of India conjures up in mind a lush image of the serene north-eastern region, there also exists equally unique destinations in the Indian mainland that can catch you off guard with their diversive dimension. And one such place in India that will definitely be a world of wonder to unravel in all its picture-perfect prettiness is Daringbadi.</p>
<h3><strong>The Unique Charm of Daringbadi</strong></h3>
<p>What makes this <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/tourist-places-in-orissa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">place in Odisha</a> instantly endearing to nature lovers and tourists is its peculiar distinction. As the only region in the eastern Indian state that receives snowfall, Daringbadi will delight you to no end. Just imagine, vistas of gorgeous greenery lacquered in thin sheets of snow within a state that gets as hot as it can! As a <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/famous-indian-hill-stations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hill station</a>, Daringbadi offers all it can in terms of its picturesque expanse and pleasant ambience. So much so that in all its charm and cheer, the place has even come to be known as the ‘Kashmir of Odisha’. With an epithet so coveted, Daringbadi does offer you all the reasons to go tripping in its luxuriant threshold of natural abundance at least once in your lifetime.</p>
<h3><strong>Enigmatic Beauty and Natural Treasures</strong></h3>
<p>In its definite enigma as a hill station, Daringbadi is very much an envelope of treasures lesser encountered in this part of the country. Refreshing greens, hazy mists, splendid scenery, cool climes—this popular tourist destination is a gem. Situated at a height of 3000 feet, this verdant region is surrounded by the lush green hills of Phulbani on one side. In Odisha’s Kandhamal district, Daringbadi sits pretty not just in the carousel of its greens and the pleasantries of its appeal. The region is as much of a haven in its pine forests and coffee plantations, not to mention its many waterfalls and rivers and of course its simplistic tribal population.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9450" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-the-Kashmir-of-Odisha.jpg" alt="Daringbadi, the Kashmir of Odisha" width="900" height="550" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-the-Kashmir-of-Odisha.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-the-Kashmir-of-Odisha-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-the-Kashmir-of-Odisha-768x469.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h3><strong>The Magic of Frost and Charm</strong></h3>
<p>Named after a British officer Daring Sahab who was in charge of the place, it however would not be entirely correct to celebrate the beauty of Daringbadi as one that allures with its snowy expanse. Rather it is the ammil or the layer of frost and ice that covers the grass and the greens and makes it sparkle as if it were snow. However, even with or without some real snowflakes settling on its misty meadows and vibrant valleys, Daringbadi is no less magical a place to lose yourselves in. In its quaint charm and luxuriant beauty, this hill station in <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/odisha" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Odisha</a> is an equal wonder you would end up raving about.</p>

<h3><strong>The Serenity of Doluri River</strong></h3>
<p>Another watery expanse that crisscrosses its majestic way through the expanse of a scenic Daringbadi is the equally scenic Doluri River. Originating from the forest slopes, the river serves as a pretty trekking route as well. Flowing calmly across rocks and accommodating a series of smaller waterfalls, this sightly manifestation in the confines of a land as majestic in its beauty is sure a treat to devour for the soul and the senses.</p>
<h3><strong>Enchanted Pines and Diverse Greens</strong></h3>
<p>Like any other hill station on earth, Daringbadi is magically set apart by its psithurism of the pines. As soon as you set foot in this magical abode of surreal splendor in a land characterised otherwise by the sea, sands, and the sun, the mysticism of a dense growth of pine trees will take you aback with its otherworldly magic. Rising tall and green from the rich red soils of the hills, this entire canopy of dark lure will do to your senses what not even the most exuberant hues can. In discovering the dark enchantment of the pines, Daringbadi helps you to discover your inner peace and calm.</p>

Already unique in its seating in the coastal land of Odisha, this discovery of divinity is replete in all the entrenches of nature. From soothing greens to arousing ones, from the deepest of shades to the most subtle ones, green is always a profusion of glory and never an envy while in Daringbadi. With also Mahua trees blooming in wild abundance, you finally gain a sense of the intoxication that a mere tryst with Daringbadi is enough to have you craving for.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9449" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-Hill-Station.jpg" alt="Daringbadi Hill Station" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-Hill-Station.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-Hill-Station-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-Hill-Station-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h3><strong>The Hill View Point Experience</strong></h3>
<p>The most popular vantage point in Daringbadi, from where you can take in the ample beauty of the place in a realization quite distinctive, is the Hill View Point.

For panoramic sunrises and romantic sunsets or for simply a magnificent all-round view of the pristine place called Daringbadi, a visit to Hill View Point is a must.</p>

<h3><strong>The Serenity of Lover’s Point</strong></h3>
<p>There’s another place in Daringbadi with the ‘Point’ suffix that is a prime tourist attraction. Known as Lover’s Point, this rocky facade with the waters streaming past in all its gurgling fantasy and quiet tranquility is truly one of the places that will make you fall in love. A very calm, silent spot where you can just sit down and watch the river as it makes its way past the grey of the rocks amidst the green of the terrains, Lover’s Point is a different beauty altogether. Even in being very uncharacteristic of a hill station, Lover’s Point will actually make you feel all the more grateful for stumbling upon the elusive gem called Daringbadi.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: A Hidden Gem</strong></h3>
<p>A tribal hinterland and one that smells of the rustic essence of nature in its simplistic way to life, Daringbadi is but a serene hamlet. Picturesque to perfection, calming to a point that is almost riveting and all the more special in its variegated claim to touristry fame, this is a place emerging from the land of beaches and temples in a manner so redolent of the misty musing of snowy precincts that has led it to be eulogised in stature to the extant heaven on earth that is Kashmir. Indeed in its spectacular indulgent facade of the charms and chills, Daringbadi is as dreamy as any earthy place can possibly be.</p>
