										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ram Mandir, located in Ayodhya, India, holds immense significance as the birthplace of Lord Rama, a revered deity in Hinduism. The construction of this magnificent temple has been a long-standing dream for millions of devotees worldwide. As a place of profound spiritual importance, many pilgrims yearn to visit the Ram Mandir and seek blessings. However, determining the best time to plan a visit requires careful consideration of various factors, such as weather conditions, festival celebrations, and crowd levels. In this article, we will explore the different seasons and festivals that can enhance your experience while visiting the Ram Mandir.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8859" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Ram-Mandir.jpg" alt="Ram Mandir" width="750" height="450" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Ram-Mandir.jpg 750w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Ram-Mandir-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<h3><strong>Spring: Embrace the Mild Weather and Festive Spirit</strong></h3>
<p>Spring, which spans from February to April, is considered an ideal time to visit the Ram Mandir. The weather during this season is pleasant, with moderate temperatures and clear skies, allowing visitors to explore the temple complex comfortably. The springtime also coincides with several significant festivals, adding vibrancy and fervour to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The festival of Holi, celebrated in March, is a magnificent spectacle in Ayodhya. Devotees and tourists alike gather to participate in the colourful festivities, where the town comes alive with joyous music, dance, and the throwing of collared powders. This joyous occasion presents a unique opportunity to witness the local culture and immerse oneself in the spiritual fervour surrounding the festival.</p>
<h3><strong>Autumn: Witness Grand Celebrations during Navratri and Diwali</strong></h3>
<p>Another favourable time to visit the Ram Mandir is during the autumn season, which spans from September to November. The weather during this period is pleasant, with cooler temperatures and a gentle breeze. Autumn in Ayodhya is marked by two major Hindu festivals &#8211; Navratri and Diwali &#8211; making it an auspicious time to visit the Ram Mandir.</p>
<p>Navratri, a nine-night festival dedicated to the goddess Durga, is celebrated with great enthusiasm in Ayodhya. The town is adorned with lights and decorations, and devotees flock to the Ram Mandir to seek the blessings of Lord Rama and the divine feminine energy. The temple complex resonates with devotional chants and spiritual fervour during this time, creating an ambiance of religious significance.</p>
<p>Following Navratri, Diwali, the festival of lights, is celebrated with immense zeal and grandeur. The entire town is illuminated with earthen lamps and decorative lights, casting a magical glow over Ayodhya. The Ram Mandir is beautifully adorned and attracts a large number of devotees who come to offer prayers and witness the spectacular fireworks displays. The auspiciousness of Diwali adds a touch of divinity to the experience, making it an unforgettable visit to the Ram Mandir.</p>
<h3><strong>Off-Season: Enjoy Serenity and Lesser Crowds</strong></h3>
<p>While spring and autumn are popular times to visit the Ram Mandir, some travellers prefer to explore the temple during the off-season to enjoy a more tranquil and introspective experience. The months of May to August constitute the summer season in Ayodhya, with temperatures ranging from warm to hot.</p>
<p>During the summer months, the number of tourists visiting Ayodhya decreases, allowing for a more serene and peaceful visit to the Ram Mandir. The reduced crowd levels provide ample opportunities for devotees to spend quality time in prayer and contemplation. Additionally, the reduced footfall often leads to shorter queues, enabling a smoother darshan (sighting) of the deities.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that visiting during the off-season requires proper preparation for the heat and humidity. Carrying sun protection, staying hydrated, and wearing light and comfortable clothing are essential during this time.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The best time to visit Ram Mandir in Ayodhya depends on personal preferences and the experience one seeks. Spring and autumn offer pleasant weather and the added charm of festival celebrations. The vibrant atmosphere during Holi, Navratri, and Diwali enhances the spiritual journey. On the other hand, the off-season provides a more serene and introspective experience, with fewer crowds and a chance for peaceful devotion.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Ram Mandir holds its sanctity throughout the year, and a visit to this sacred place is an opportunity to connect with spirituality and witness the rich cultural heritage of Ayodhya.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7270" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keshi-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan.jpg" alt="Keshi Ghat - Ghats of Vrindavan" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keshi-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keshi-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keshi-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan-170x110.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keshi-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan-370x238.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Keshi Ghat is the most famous and prominent bathing Ghats of Vrindavan. Gracing the banks of Yamuna River, Keshi Ghat is not only a significant spot for devotees to take a holy dip but also one of the prettiest and well-made Ghats here. Set against the backdrop of Madanmohan temple, the Ghat is made with incredibly detailed and finely carved out inlaid stone work which further beautifies the entire environment. The Ghat is so important that anyone who sees it, takes a bath in it, drinks its water or even gets a whiff of the water here, is purified. The ghat is named after a legendary incident where Lord Krishna is said to have killed the demon Keshi by choking him with a lotus flower. The lord had then made his way to the spot where Keshi Ghat currently stands and had taken a bath purifying his soul.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Radha Bagh Ghat</strong></h3>
<p>Every path, lane or establishment in Vrindavan, Mathura, and most of its vicinity reminds and deeply resonates with the historical and legendary past this place is associated with. Radha Bagh Ghat is one such historically significant Ghat located in the backyard of the Radha Rani Mandir in Barsana, a small holy town located in very close proximity to the main city of Vrindavan. The place gives an otherworldly vibe because it is surrounded by not only the holy sthalams but also with lush green and age-old tree groves. The beauty of this place is amplified by the presence of numerous peacocks which is reminiscent of the lord since peacocks are associated with Lord Krishna. The Ghat is a beautiful place to just sit back, relax and watch the peacocks (associated with Lord Krishna) fly by.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Sri Andhra Chat Ghat</strong></h3>
<p>Radha and Krishna are known for having loving fights and were very playful with each other. Many of their depictions show them running around and having a playful banter with each other. Vrindavan was the place where Lord Krishna grew up playing and fooling around with Radha. Sri Andhra Chat Ghat is a small, lesser <strong>popular Ghat in Vrindavan</strong> where Radha and Krishna used to play hide and seek in and around the Ghat. This aspect of Krishna’s life forms a major part of his personality and offers the devotees a small glimpse into the glorious life of Kanha. The Ghat also functions as a Chhath Ghat during the holy occasion for the people of eastern India.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Kaliya Daman Ghat</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7269" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kaliya-Daman-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan.jpg" alt="Kaliya Daman Ghat - Ghats of Vrindavan" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kaliya-Daman-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kaliya-Daman-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kaliya-Daman-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan-170x110.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kaliya-Daman-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan-370x238.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Kaliya Daman Ghat is another one of the <strong>most important and holiest of all Ghats in Vrindavan</strong>. A major historical event related to the life and time of Krishna had taken place on this very Ghat. The Ghat is named after a demon snake creature that the Lord had fought and subdued. The thousand hooded snake is said to have made the Yamuna River its new home and spit poison into the life-giving river source for the rest of the town of Vrindavan and had the snake continued doing so, it would have put the lives of several innocent locals in danger. Krishna sat on the Ghat and fought the thousand-headed snake and ended up killing it and saving the lives of many. After the completion of the fight, the Lord himself was seen dancing on top of the demon snake&#8217;s head. While <strong>planning a trip to Vrindavan</strong> make sure to go to this Ghat and learn more about the incredible past of Krishna’s hometown.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Sri Varaha Ghat</strong></h3>
<p>Varaha is a boar avatar of Lord Vishnu which is also depicted as the 3rd avatar in the Dashavatar form. Gracing the southwestern bank of Yamuna River that runs and fuels life in the lives of the locals in Vrindavan, Varaha Ghat Temple can be seen in the southwestern end of Sri Vrindavan, in the old Yamuna banks. The Ghat is named after the incident when Lord Krishna had transcended into the life form of a wild boar for every gopi’s pleasure. Another story says that during the sat yug era, a demon had shaken the hard really violently which flicked the earth off its orbit and deep into the bottom of universe which meant impure conditions for the gods. During that time the wild boar a.k.a Lord Krishna picked up the earth from the deep trenches and back into its orbit.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Cheer Ghat</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7267" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cheer-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan.jpg" alt="Cheer Ghat - Ghats of Vrindavan" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cheer-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cheer-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cheer-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan-170x110.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Cheer-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan-370x238.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Continuing the <strong>list of important Ghats in Vrindavan</strong>, Chir Ghat had to be mentioned. This prominent <strong>Ghat in Vrindavan</strong> is located very close to the iconic Keshi Ghat and very close to Radha Damodar Temple. If you are familiar with the story about Lord Krishna joking around with the Gopis taking a bath in the <strong>lakes of Vrindavan</strong>, then this is the place where it used to happen a major part of the time. The Kadamba Tree, where Krishna used to sit with the Gopi’s clothing can still be seen there. Devotees can be seen tying holy red colored clothes if they want their wishes to be fulfilled and for women it is believed that doing this will get girls good grooms for the future. Going to this Ghat will be a very eye-opening experience for many.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Bihari Ghat</strong></h3>
<p>Bihari Ghat is named after the temple where the Ghat is located which is the Yugal Bihari Temple. Sri Yugal Kishore Ji temple is one of the oldest standing temples in Vrindavan which was built in 1627. Some credit for the creation of the temple and Ghat goes to the Mughal emperor Akbar, who had visited this temple during the 1500s and had ordered the temple to be built. The Ghat is also located so close to Keshi Ghat that it can be easily confused with Keshi. The story of the temple goes back to the time of Akbar rule when the Vaishnav community had asked the king for his permission to build the temple and instead of one he gave permission to build 4 temples.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Surya Ghat</strong></h3>
<p>Located very close to Madan Mohan Temple is Surya Ghat and the city holds a very special space in the hearts of Krishna devotees. According to written records and ancient mythological writings, Lord Krishna spent a lot of time soaking up the sun in this Ghat. Especially after the Kaliya Daman Fight, Lord Krishna was soaking wet and he laid down on the Ghat to properly dry himself off. This was also the time when Surya Dev came out in full power in an attempt to completely and properly dry out the lord. This goes on to show the importance of this place and why devotees make their way here to offer their prayer to the Lord himself.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Gopal Ghat</strong></h3>
<p>There are many aspects of Krishna’s life centered around the <strong>small villages of Vrindavan</strong> and Mathura. Even the places where he used to casually spend time are extremely holy for the devotees and local residents as well. Named after the loving name of Krishna, Gopal, the Ghat signifies another important account of his life. Gopal Ghat is the same location where an extremely overjoyed Nand baba had offered a couple of cows to the Brahmans nearby after having found out that his son Krishna was alive even after a very lengthy underwater fight with the thousand-headed demon serpent. This makes the Ghat an incredibly holy spot for not just devotees but also for anyone who believes in the lord.</p>
<h3><strong>10. Govind Ghat</strong></h3>
<p>Govind Ghat is another one of the <strong>important Ghats in Vrindavan</strong> although it is not as popular or well known as the others. This was the place where Radha Ji had come back to meet with Lord Krishna. Due to some emergency, she had to leave him behind in the middle of a raas which had made the lord very sad. The Ghat in a way signifies the happiness that was felt by the lord on the return of his lover after a long and desperate wait. You can go there, spend time soaking in the piousness and holy value of this place.</p>
<h3><strong>11. Bhramar Ghat</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7266" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bhramar-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan.jpg" alt="Bhramar Ghat - Ghats of Vrindavan" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bhramar-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bhramar-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bhramar-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan-170x110.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Bhramar-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan-370x238.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
You may know Ghats as the steps leading from the main road and into the river and unlike regular steps these have a whole lot of historical and mythological significance associated with them. Unlike other Ghats, Bhramar Ghat looks like a simple and humble river side with the land leading you up to the river side with the absence of the regular steps. This is an incredibly idyllic spot which is surrounded by lots of greenery, colorful flowers, plants and other flora collections. The reason behind the naming of the Ghat Bhramar is the fact that these flowers and trees attract swarms of bumble bees which creates that buzzing sound from where the Ghat gets its name from.</p>
<h3><strong>12. Imli Tala Ghat</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7268" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Imli-Tala-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan.jpg" alt="Imli Tala Ghat - Ghats of Vrindavan" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Imli-Tala-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Imli-Tala-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Imli-Tala-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan-170x110.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Imli-Tala-Ghat-Ghats-of-Vrindavan-370x238.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Imli Tala Ghat is all about epitomizing an anguish of intense love felt by Krishna and Radha during their separation time period. Simply translated, Imli Tala means tamarind tree, which merely describes the surroundings of this place. However, according to Indian mythological references, Imli Tala symbolizes the time when Radha Raani had to leave the sharad Purnima raas dance leaving Krishna feeling intense pangs of separation and sadness. Although the Ghat is not immediately present right next to the course of Yamuna River, since the river has changed its course over a long period of time, it is still an important part for Krishna devotees who come here to reminisce about that golden period while also offering their prayer to the lord and taking his blessings.</p>
<h3><strong>13. Yugal Ghat</strong></h3>
<p>Yugal Kishore temple is one of the many temples located in Vrindavan that is incredibly famous for its mythological importance and relation to the life stories of Lord Krishna. The temple is majestic, huge, and very well made. Located right in the back side of the temple complex is the Yugal Ghat. The Ghat is famous for many different reasons and religious values. According to mythological accounts and available written records, the divine couple, Radha Krishan, used to bathe together in the waters of Yamuna River right at this spot. People also believe that if you take a bath in the waters of Yugal Ghat you may spot the divine couple taking a bath themselves. Watching the sun setting on the horizon here is an experience in itself.</p>
<h3><strong>14. Sri Raj Ghat</strong></h3>
<p>Sri Raj Ghat in Vrindavan is another one of the places where Krishna would play one of his many games with the Gopis here. During one of his fun charades, Lord Krishna had disguised himself as a boatman in order to take the Gopis across the river on boat. He did so by covering himself in large cloaks in order to confuse the Gopis and protect his identity. The boatman demanded to wash the feet of one of the Gopis in exchange for taking the group of Gopis across the Yamuna River to sell their milk products in the market. He chose Radha Rani’s feet to wash, after which the Gopis and the disguised lord were on their way. In the middle of rowing, Krishna demanded he wanted to eat the milk products because he was weak, after eating some products he laid down in a slump saying he was sleepy after all that eating. This angered the Gopis who then removed the huge cloak from the lord’s face and saw Krishna pulling a prank on them.</p>
<h3><strong>15. Adi Badri Ghat</strong></h3>
<p>You may already be familiar with the term Adi Badri, which means the Badrinath of the future. You may already know that Lord Krishna is an avatar of Lord Vishnu, who had said that he would be coming back to earth in different forms throughout the duration of earth’s existence. The Adi Badri Ghat is a secluded little Ghat with very little tourist footfall. Located in the southern edge of the holy town of Vrindavan, where now you can see many different sadhus and sages performing meditation and yoga around the vicinity of the Ghat. This Ghat is the place where the Lord had appeared in the form of Adi Badri at the request of his precious Gopis.</p>
<h3><strong>16. Sri Jagannath Ghat</strong></h3>
<p>By now you may know that almost every Ghat has some major or minor significance related to the life and times of Lord Krishna. The story behind this Ghat is an interesting one. The story starts with one of the sages or a Brahman having a dream about Lord Jagannath where he was seen asking the sage to grant him a wish to take him to Vrindavan. During that time the Jagannath Temple of Orissa was very popular (and still is) since it is the eastern pillar of <strong>the holy Char Dham Yatra</strong>. The hermit then contacted the priest at the Jagannath Temple in Orissa and narrated the entire story to him who then suggested he should take this up with the king of Orissa then. He only agreed to do so if Lord Jagannath had appeared in his dreams and instructed the king to do so. Magically it happened and the king allowed the hermit to get a beautiful temple and a Ghat constructed dedicated to Lord Jagannath.</p>
<h3><strong>17. Shringar Vat Ghat</strong></h3>
<p>Many Ghats in Vrindavan are either named after the lord himself, the Gopis, Radha, or the activity that was performed by the lord in that very place. Literally translated, Shringar Vat means a decorated banyan tree. The Ghat is one of those beautiful and holiest places where Lord Krishna had decorated his beloved Radha Rani with flowers. The Ghat is located in one of the oldest living <strong>temples in Vrindavan</strong> with a lot of historical and mythological relevance in the life of devotees and local residents. The place signifies a love reunited when Krishna had found Radha Rani here and was so pleased to see her that he decorated her with flowers.</p>
<p>Vrindavan is all about spirituality, peace, and serving the will of the lord in a serene manner. Even if you are not a Krishna devotee, <strong>going to Vrindavan</strong> not just for the temples but also for the Ghats will be an enriching experience.</p>

First time in Kashi and don’t know what do to or where to go? Go to Assi Ghat. This is the southernmost Ghat in the long line of Ghats which form the outer border of Varanasi and it also consists of a shivling located under a Peepal Tree. During the evening Aarti time this riverside gets engulfed in a deep sense of mysticism which is followed by the rhythmic swinging of the Aarti as a way of paying an ode to Ganga Mata. You have the option of witnessing this beauty from the stairs of the ghats or from the boat in front of the Ghat.

<li><strong>Country:</strong> India</li>
<li><strong>State:</strong> Uttar Pradesh</li>
<li><strong>District:</strong> Lucknow</li>
<li><strong>Area:</strong> 2,528 square kilometres (metro)</li>
<li><strong>Elevation:</strong> 128 m</li>
<li><strong>Population: </strong>3 million</li>
<li><strong>Pin code:</strong> 226</li>

<li><strong>Time Zone:</strong> GMT plus 5:30</li>
</ul>
<p>Lucknow (also known by the names of City of the Nawabs or the Golden City of the East, Shiraz-i-Hind, Constantinople of India), is the capital of Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state located in the northern heartland of India. One of the ninety Minority Concentrated Districts of India, Lucknow is famous for its architecture, gardens, music, poetry and cuisines. It is a popular subject of study for the keen students of history and culture. Lucknow is the second largest city of Uttar Pradesh after Kanpur and is a fast-growing metro city in India.</p>
<p>Lucknow historically has been a learning centre in Hindi and Urdu. The city is famous for its Urdu Shayari (poetry).</p>
<p><strong>History</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2051" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lucknow-the-city-of-Nababs.jpg" alt="Lucknow the city of Nababs" width="700" height="452" /><br />
The city of Lucknow and its adjoining parts in the Awadh region came under the successive rule of the  Gaya Bihar Sultanate, the Mughals, the Nawabs of Awadh and the British since the mid-14th century. It was also an important centre of action during the Sepoy mutiny of 1857 as well as the freedom movement against the British rule.</p>
<p>Till the second decade of the 18th century, Awadh was a part of the Mughals administered by a Governor appointed by the Mughal Emperor in  Gaya Bihar. Awadh has historically been known as the granary house of India and it was strategically a key place for controlling the Doab region between the Ganga and Yamuna Rivers. Awadh has been a strong kingdom till the third Nawab; Shuja-ud-Daula succumbed to the British in the Battle of Buxar of 1964 while aiding Mir Qasim, the fugitive Nawab of Bengal.  Thereafter, the defeated king had to cede parts of his kingdom as well as penalties to the east India Company. The British also appointed a Resident at Awadh and gradually brought it under their strong control. They, however, abstained from capturing Awadh for that would have brought them under direct confrontation with the Marathas and the Mughals, even though the latter was in decline. Lucknow came into prominence when it was promoted as the capital of Awadh by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula. The Awadhi Nawabs had made lasting contributions towards the architectural magnificence of the city.</p>
<p>In 1798, the fifth Nawab, Wazir Ali abdicated and the British, subsequently, helped Saadat Khan to accede to the throne. A puppet king was installed by the British in the form of Saadat Khan, who by a treaty with the British in 1801, had given half of Awadh to the British East India Company and the state virtually became a vassal state of the Europeans. All revenues and assets of Awadh were spent behind the Britishers while the inefficient Awadhi rulers continued with their luxurious and pompous lifestyles. In 1856, the East India Company took military initiative and annexed Awadh, their long awaiting desire and put the kingdom under Sir Henry Lawrence’s command. The Nawab, Wajid Ali Shah was captured and put to exile. Wajid Ali’s minor son was crowned the king during the 1857 revolt during when Sir Lawrence was killed. Lucknow was sieged as well. However, the British later recaptured Awadh after the rebellion met a defeat. It was put under a chief commissioner once again.</p>
<p>In 1901, Lucknow, which served as the capital of Awadh since 1775, was merged with the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (Anglicized version of Awadh) and was made the provincial capital in 1920. In 1947 after India gained independence, Lucknow became the capital of Uttar Pradesh, or the erstwhile Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>The city had played a historical role during the modern Indian freedom movement as well. The famous Lucknow pact of 1916 was signed here while it had strong connections with the Khilafat Movement. During the Khilafat Movement, Maulana Abdul Bari of Lucknow had actively co-operated with Mahatma Gandhi and Maulana Mohammad Ali.</p>
<p>The All India Kisan Sabha was formed at the Lucknow session of the Indian national Congress in 1936 to organize and lead peasant grievances against the oppressive zamindars and it played an instrumental role in igniting the farmers’ movement in India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to this site of sacred deer park where Gautama Buddha taught Dharma for the first time following his enlightenment. Situated at 12 km from the Hindu pious city of Varanasi, Sarnath is considered among the four blessed Buddhist sites endorsed by Lord Buddha including Lumbini – his Birthplace, Bodh Gaya &#8211; his Enlightenment site, and Kushinagar &#8211; his death site.</p>
<p><strong>Legend</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1890" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Buddhist-Monk.jpg" alt="Buddhist Monk" width="700" height="321" /><br />
Formerly known as Mrigadayavan meaning deer park and Isipatana meaning the site of falling of the holy men onto the planet (In Pali, ‘is’ means holy men). A legend is associated with the second name according to which when Lord Buddha was born, heavenly gods (devas) appeared on Earth to inform about it to 500 holy men who disappeared leading to the fall of their remains on the ground.</p>
<p>The modern name Sarnath (Saranganath) literally indicates Lord of the Deer named after an ancient Buddhist story. According to this, Bodhisattva is a deer who provides his life to a king rather than the doe he wanted to slay. Upon this devotion, the king created the park as a deer’s haven.</p>
<h3><strong>Sarnath History</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1891" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Circumambulating-Stupas.jpg" alt="Circumambulating Stupas" width="700" height="372" /><br />
Lord Buddha, when attained enlightenment, first came here to preach his manifested experience, and discovered his first five escorts to make them enlighten. This is called “Spinning the wheel of the Dharma” that commemorates the origin of the Sangha – the congregation of monks. His first sermon was in Pali and is known as the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta followed by his core teachings on the Four Noble Truths (meaning of life) and the Noble Eightfold Path (the precise manner of living). Residing at Mulagandhakuti Vihara in next rainy season, Lord Buddha’s Sangha totaled to 60 after which he told those monks to reach far and wide and preach the Dharma to the people.</p>
<p>After Buddha, Buddhism grew in leaps and bounds in Sarnath due to the backing of kings and rich trade People of Varanasi. Until the 3rd century, Sarnath famed its name as an important hub of arts towering the sky at the time of the Gupta period that was from 4th to 6th century. According to Hsuan Tsang who visited Sarnath in the 7th century from China, there were 30 monasteries and 3000 monks. Later, Sarnath was a prime hub of the Sammatiya school of Buddhism, which is among the Nikaya or Hinayana schools.</p>
<p>However, at the end of the 12th century, Turkish Muslims attacked the town damaging almost all the prime buildings and monuments after which it was looted for making other structures. This ruined state is what you see today. Finally, until 1836 A.D., the location was completely made empty and it was at this time when the British started their digit activity along with renovation.</p>
<h4><strong>Sarnath Attractions</strong></h4>
<p>This is an imposing structure of 128 feet high with 46.5 as radius among the ruins. This marks the holy place where Lord Buddha is supposed to have Teacher his first companion. The Stupa was built somewhere around 200 BC. You can see only its foundations, but worth noting, as it is a rare pre-Ashokan stupa.</p>
<p><strong>Mulagandhakuti Vihara</strong></p>
<p>Now as crumbling ruins, this is the site where Lord Buddha stayed in meditation at the time of his first rainy season after enlightenment. According to a writer of the 7th century, the Vihara was 200 feet high and had 100 niches housing a carving of the Buddha along each wall. Here, a life-sized idol depicts Buddha spinning the wheel of Dharma.</p>
<p><strong>Modern Mulagandhakuti Vihara</strong></p>
<p>Located to the east of the ruined one, this modern Vihara boasts wonderful wall paintings. At its rear, there is the Deer Park that is actually a free animal park alluring deer.</p>
<p><strong>The Ashoka Pillar</strong></p>
<p>The pillar’s base is still surviving at its initial location and offers some pleasant carvings. Although it was alive after the Turkish invasion, later, it was wrecked at the time of excavations.</p>
<p><strong>Sarnath Archaeological Museum</strong></p>
<p>This displays the glorious lion capital once sitting on the pillar and yet survived after its fall from 45 foot. In addition, you can have a glimpse of some of the hidden gems of the Indian Buddhist art with its 300 images.</p>
<p><strong>Bodhi Tree</strong></p>
<p>Situated besides a Sri Lankan Monastery, this tree considered as sacred was planted by Anagarika Dharmapala that was cut from the Bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya. It is said that below this tree at Bodh Gaya, Gautam Buddha achieved enlightenment.</p>
<p><strong>Six National Temples</strong></p>
<p>These were built by different Asian communities at Sarnath after the restoration of the site. A Tibetan temple and Sri Lankan temple are a part of these shrines.</p>
