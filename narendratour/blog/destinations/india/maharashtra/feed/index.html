										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now it’s the time to have some adventure, this voice came from Chetan in the middle breaking the silence of the breakfast table in the cafe. First we all thought he was talking on his cell phone but in fraction of seconds we realized that he was talking to us, but we didn’t get what he was trying to convey to us. Aksuu asked him what was he saying, then he said, “lets plan a visit to a fort this weekend, no one uttered a word and Chetan was waiting for our answer, everyone though was agreeing to the plan but were thinking something. I was always ready for outings so I gave my immediate answer, after me even Aksu, Varsha and Ellu said yes. But Vaibhav and Sachin were still thinking, I thought maybe they had some other plan and they might be thinking of shuffling things after pausing for 5 minutes they both were too ready. Somewhere in my mind I had a thought, that my mom was surely going to kill me some day as each weekend I was always on some or other outing.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-8567 alignright" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Harishchandragad.jpg" alt="Harishchandragad" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>Now the whole week was to pass for Saturday and our adventure outing, till that time we have to work, our destination for the adventure outing was the famous Harishchandragad which is in the Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra. This fort as its mention in the history connecting to the Malshej Ghat for the protection of surrounding areas. All were trying to get as much information we could about the place, to reach Harishchandragad it takes around eight hours from Mumbai by road. It was Friday and only hours were left for starting our adventure journey, we had planned to leave home by 5 am, so that we reach on time and encounter less traffic in the road. We that day left on the decided time as it was a long journey. The moment we reached Malshej ghat as we read the view that Malshej ghat gave to the Harishchandragad was extremely mind blowing. Here there is no facility for food or accommodation so we were camping there.</p>
<p>After reaching at the place I was thrilled to see the height of the Harishchandragad which is of 4,671 feet. The most fascinating summit on Harishchandragad is the cliff that has constantly enthralled several people since years. Facing to the west the cliff looks towards Konkan. Here is the place from you can have an awesome view of the surrounding region and also the setting of the sun. There are few spots here places in the Harishchandragad which is worth watching, we also decided to have a look at those.</p>
<p><strong>Saptatirtha:</strong></p>
<p>This is the temple that is constructed in the lake on the eastern side and is called as “Saptatirtha”. In these temples you will find idols of Lord Vishnu. These idols now are shifted to the nearby caves. The water in the lake here is contaminated because of many trekkers; few years back the water which was used for drinking is not even suitable for swimming now.</p>
<p><strong>Taramati Peak:</strong></p>
<p>This is the highest point of the fort. From behind you can have a look at Leopards here. Also as of here you can have a look at the entire Naneghat and the forts nearing Murbad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Undoubtedly recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site, the Ellora caves and the Elephanta Caves, India are situated close to the old village of Ellora in the Maharashtra State. Built between the 6th and 10th centuries, the caves are dedicated to the Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain temples with wonderful carvings and sculptures. Its name and fame has entitled the caves as the No. 1 frequently visited ancient monument in the nation.</p>
<p>The 34 impressive caves include 12 Buddhist caves of 500-750 AD, 17 Hindu caves of 600-870 AD, and 5 Jain caves of 800-1000 AD. You can identify the caves with their chronological numbers starting from the oldest Buddhist caves in the south.</p>
<h3><strong>My Trip Experience Maharashtra Caves</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3477" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/List-of-Caves-in-Maharashtra.jpg" alt="List of Caves in Maharashtra" width="741" height="486" /><br />
I first started with the 17 Buddhist Caves, also known as the Vishvakarma caves, which are all monasteries utilized for study, meditation, and rituals. Among the Buddhist architecture of the Ellora caves, India, the Cave labeled 10 is not a monastery.</p>
<p>Cave 1 is quite simple holding eight monastic cells that might have been a granary, while Cave 2 is comparatively more stunning whose doorway is holding a strong Padmapani with a lotus and adorned future Buddha &#8211; Maitreya. Within, a huge middle chamber with 12 square pillars is decorated with seated Buddhas and a shrine holds a seated Buddha on a lion throne. Cave 3 and 4 resemble this cave, but are not well maintained.</p>
<p>Cave 5, the Maharwada Cave, is so named as the local Mahar tribe used to stay here in the monsoons. There is a majestic assembly hall that might have been a dining hall due to the presence of the dual rows of carved benches. The Buddha is seen on a stool where in his right hand is touching the ground via the Earth Witness gesture. Cave 6 is where you can see two superb sculptures of the cave complex. In the left, the sculpture of the goddess Tara with a deep, kind look is carved, while to here opposite is Mahamayuri, the goddess of learning with the peacock and an attentive student below. In Hinduism, she is Goddess Saraswati.</p>
<p>The spectacular Cave 10, the Carpenter’s Cave, is so called due to its replica in stone of wooden beams on the top area. Check out for a seated Buddha in the facade of a large stone stupa. Next, Cave 11, the Dho Tal or Two Floors cave, defies its fact of being the three floor carving. The upper floor holds a long assembly with columns and houses a Buddha shrine along with sculpts of Goddess Durga and Shree Ganesh. This says that the cave was then a Hindu temple. Lastly, I visited Cave 12, the Tin Tal, housing a great upper hall, a shrine whose walls hold five large bodhisattvas and seven Buddhas – all revealing the former incarnations of the Enlightened One.</p>
<p>Numbered 13 to 29, the Hindu caves are carved in a different style and occupy the surroundings of the popular Kailasa Temple in the complex of the Ellora caves India. Most of them are dedicated to Lord Shiva, but also have images of Lord Vishnu and his incarnations. The walls of these caves are decorated with beautiful bas-reliefs showing famous Hindu tales.</p>
<p>The Cave 14 was previously a Buddhist monastery where the Goddess Yamuna and Ganga guard the doorway. The lengthy walls offer splendidly carved friezes, while a niche within houses seven fertility goddesses (the Sapta Matrikas) with fat babies on their laps. To the right, check out for the female form of Lord Ganesh and Kala and Kali – the ghastly goddesses of death. Cave 15 was also a Buddhist cave famous for the ideal sculpture on the top floor. Along the right wall, note the panels of five Vishnu’s incarnations (avatars) due to which the cave is called the Dashavatara. Look out for the panel wherein Lord Shiva rises from the Jyotirlinga and that Shree Brahma and Shree Vishnu attend with modesty. The most attractive sculpture is in the left wall – Lord Shiva as Nataraja, the Cosmic Dancer.</p>
<p>Cave 16 is the most appreciated one, which is a great temple made from a solid rock. It showcases the residence of Lord Shiva – Mount Kailash due to which it is known as the Kailashnath, Kailash, or Kailasa Temple. Initially, a thick coat of white plaster was seen so that it appeared as a snowy mountain. The temple is double in size of the Parthenon in Athens with quite alluring spatial and architectural features that took 100 years of construction. Going down the hillside from here, other temples are carved, out of which 21, 25, and 29 are really beautiful.</p>
<p>The most ancient Hindu cave is Cave 21, the Rameswaram, which offers superb sculptures – dual river goddesses and dual door guardians. Cave 25 is dedicated to the sun god Surya seen as driving his cosmic chariot. From here, you need go steeply down to reach a gorge and then up to Cave 29, the Dhumar Lena, holding a peculiar cross-shaped plan. While the steps are guarded by the lions, its walls are decorated with grand friezes. At the entrance’s left, Lord Shiva is shown killing the Andhaka demon and overcoming the Ravana’s effort to jolt him and his wife Parvati atop Mount Kailash. Look for a dwarf taunting the demon and how Lord Shiva taunts at Goddess Parvati by taking her arm back when she is about to throw the dice for a game.</p>
<p>At the Ellora caves India, the Jain caves are seen two km down a tarmac road exhibiting the unique Jain philosophy and tradition with strict asceticism and great decoration. Several of them houses lavish paintings in the ceilings. Cave 32, the Indra Sabha (Indra’s Assembly Hall), a small replica of the Kailash Temple is the most magnificent. Two tirthankaras (apostles) are seen at the entrance. At the right is the Lord Gomateswara shown mediating intensely such that his legs are covered with vines and animals crawl around him. Note the ceiling with the detailed carvings of a fine lotus flower. Another prime cave destination here is the famous Bhaja Caves which is a magnificent group of 22 rock cut cave structures and is located 400 feet above the village of Bhaja.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Elephanta Caves, one of the most visited tourist destination of India Tour is located in Mumbai, the industrial capital of Indian subcontinent. The island of Elephanta is approximately 10 kms away from the Gateway of India in Mumbai. The Elephanta caves are one of the best creations of Indian art and architecture. The meticulously worked upon rock cut wonderful caves are a jewel of Indian Tourism. According to the leading historians there was a statue of an elephant near the coast of the island and therefore it was named as Elephanta Island by the Portuguese settlers in India.<br />

The Elephanta Caves in Maharashtra state of India are one of the most celebrated and marvellous historical tourist destinations. The caves consist of splendid temples of Lord Shiva. The historical accounts narrate the stories of the great warrior Prince of Chalukya Dynasty, Pulakesin II to rejoice his victory. Elephanta Caves are an exemplar in the field of rock cut architecture, it has some of the most fabulous and magnificent megaliths carved wondrously into unimaginable human figurines and animal profiles. The spectacular cave architecture and exquisite friezes on the ceilings are simply inimitable. The main area lies in the western end of the caves which is considered to be the resting abode of the ‘Linga’, where Lord Shiva is worshipped as the God of potency and proliferation. Different frescos beautifully lined one after the other show all the holy incarnations of Lord Shiva. The temple is planned with sheer geometric arrangements that leave you in awe. The entire rock cut process was a gradual cumbersome shift and movement of rocks. Some of the rocks have refined surface while others are untouched. The entire Elephanta caves stretch over an area of about 60000 sq ft. with a main hall, two lateral chambers, a courtyard and numerous contributory shrines. There are three main entrances to the temple out of which the ones on the west and east sides are more important of the structure. The Sadasiva display of Shiva is adorned at the end of the north-south alliance. The Titanic 20 feet high image of the three-headed Shiva, is highly imposing and is a magnum opus of the great Indian art. The tourists can visit these incredible caves from 9 am to 5 pm and should avoid going in monsoon as the caves can be dangerous when it pours.</p>
<p>The origin of the Elephanta caves dates back to the ancient times of Konkani Mauryas and it were then known as Gharapuri, named after a sculpture of an elephant found there. This figure was later moved to the Bhau Daji Lad Museum near the Jijamata Udyan in Byculla, Mumbai. It is very convenient to reach Mumbai as it is one of the most important metropolitans an excellent network of air, rail and roads. The Elephanta caves are also reachable through ferries from the Gateway of India. The nearest airport is Mumbai International Airport. An India tour must include a visit to the magnanimous Elephanta Caves that are one of the most beautiful things that Indian history has gifted to the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These well-known monumental caves are a cluster of rock cut monuments. It is located deep in the lush green pristine forests of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park. This nature reserve is situated towards the north of Borivali, in the western outskirts of Mumbai, India. Distance wise it is 7 km away from Borivali railway station and 6 km from the National park gate. Tourists are allowed inside the park after 7:30am. Transport to the caves is available by bus every hour.</p>
<p>Kanheri caves depict the Buddhist influence on the art and culture of India. The word Kanheri is from the Sanskrit word ‘Krishnagiri’ which generally means black in color. These caves were designed from a huge basaltic rock formation.</p>
<p><strong>History:</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1918" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Kanheri-Caves.jpg" alt="Kanheri Caves" width="700" height="525" /><br />
The origin of the caves is from the first century BCE to the ninth century BCE. A Hundred and nine caves have been carved in the basalt rocks. A stone plinth adorns each cave as a bed. These caves are very different when compared to the elegant nearby Elephanta caves.</p>
<p>The Buddhist shrine known as stupa is founded in the congregation hall which has huge stone pillars. As you go up the hills, there are remains of ancient canals, cisterns and water systems. These collected and channeled the harvested rainwater into huge reservoirs.</p>
<p>As the caves became Buddhist monasteries intricate carvings of Buddha and bodhisattvas were made in the cave walls. It was a crucial Buddhist monastery in the Konkan coastal region in the third century AD.</p>
<p>In most of these caves Buddhist monks lived, studied and practiced meditation. The large caves were called Chaityas which were the congregational worship halls. Rock cut stupas, intricate Buddhist pillars, sculptures and reliefs lined the walls of the Chaityas for worship. The most important figure is of Avalokiteshvara. He is a bodhisattva who encompasses the compassion of all the Buddha. He is widely worshiped in Mahayana Buddhism.</p>
<p>These caves provide clues to the once well-established world of Buddhist monks. It was connected to trade centers such as ports of Kalyan, Nasik, Paithan, Sopara, and Ujjain. During the time of Kushan and Mauryan Empire, Kanheri was a university center. Also in the later tenth century, Atisha, the Buddhist teacher came to Kanheri to practice Buddhist meditation under Rahul Gupta.</p>
<p><strong>Drawings and Inscriptions:</strong></p>
<p>In Kanheri inscriptions are found in the ancient languages of Devanagari, Brahmi. Fifty one inscriptions are found at Kanheri. Three Pallavi epigraphs are seen in the cave 90. In all there are twenty six epigraphs. In one crucial inscription marriage of the daughter of Rudradaman with Satavahana ruler Vashishtiputra Satakarni is craved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thought Mumbai is an island city, the city’s high population has left little room for its beautiful beaches. Among the few popular stretches along the Arabian Sea are the Juhu beach and the Girgaum Chowpatty. In such a densely populated city, its beaches are a breath of fresh air, and their vibrant atmospheres bring together citizens of all ages.</p>
<p><strong>Juhu Beach Mumbai</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Juhu-Beach-Mumbai.jpg" alt="Juhu Beach Mumbai" width="300" height="200" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8520" /></p>
<p>Just near the beach, the Juhu aerodrome is where JRD Tata landed in 1932 inaugurating India’s first scheduled mail service. Today, the commercial airport lies a few kilometers away but Juhu beach still offers a spectacular sight of flights as they take off from the city, over the sea and far away into the horizon.</p>
<p>Juhu beach is on the must-see list of every tourist to Mumbai. One can get here from almost every point of the city by road and rail and it is close to other suburban places like Santa Cruz, Vile Parle and Andheri.</p>
<p>The beach is a welcome retreat for walkers and joggers at dawn and leisure seekers in the evening, who throng to the beach to get a respite from the city’s hectic lifestyle. It is known for its chaat food specialties like bhel puri, paw bhaji, Pani and ice Golas.</p>
<p>The ISKCON Krishna temple is a major attraction in Juhu. There are many multi-star hotels and some opulent shopping options available in the area.</p>
<p><strong>Chowpatty Beach Mumbai</strong></p>
<p>Chowpatty beach is another popular Mumbai beach. This was the location for many an important meeting of the freedom fighters during the struggle for India’s independence. Chowpatty is really Chaupati (four channels or four creeks). Lying close to the Central Business Districts of Nariman Point Churchgate and the old colonial quarters of South Mumbai, it is flanked by the trademark Marine Drive skyline on one side and the elite Malabar hill on the other.</p>
<p>A long walk along the beautiful promenade of Marine Drive and spending an hour or two through the breezy seashore makes it a pleasant getaway. Come evening, the beach transforms itself into a complete platform of entertainment. From pony rides to snake charmers and dancing monkeys to acrobats, there is something here for everybody.</p>
<p>Chowpatty beach also known as Girgaum Chowpatty, wears vibrant colors during Ganesh Visarjan, when thousands of people from across Mumbai bring Ganesha idols for immersion after ten days of worship during Ganesh Chaturthi. Mumbai’s popular snacks of vada pav, Bhelpuri, Panipuri, Ragda patties and kulfi are sold by vendors at the beach.</p>
<p>With Mumbai’s oldest skyscraper, the Air India building, the Trident Hotel, the revolving tower of the Ambassador hotel as well as the spectacular “queen’s necklace” on one side and the tall buildings of Malabar Hill tapering to Raj Bhavan, the official residence of the Governor of Maharashtra, on the other, Chowpatty offers a magnificent view of the Mumbai skyline.</p>
<p><strong>Other Beaches around Mumbai</strong></p>
<p>Within a fifty kilometer radius are located many more stunningly picturesque beaches like Madh Island which also boasts of an Old Portuguese fort and Aksa one of the quietest of beaches. Marve and Manori are pleasant beaches for bathing and Gorai, a little further away is now the location of the Global Vipassana Pagoda.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A structure that defines Mumbai in a snapshot, the Victoria Terminus, rechristened the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus is an incredible legacy chiseled in stone.</p>
<p>The landmark Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus building stands tall and imposing in the heart of Mumbai, oblivious to the scores of people that traverse its hallways every day. The iconic railway station, steeped in history is quite-literally the nerve centre of the city, what with 30 lakh-odd commuters travelling through it on a daily basis. As the sea of people push, jostle and shove to make it into their designated local train within these old walls, it’s a scene juxtaposing the past and present perfectly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-8499 alignright" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Chhatrapati-Shivaji-Terminus.jpg" alt="Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus" width="300" height="200" />Each dome, stained-glass window and turret of the CST has a tale to tell. The construction of this grand old structure began in 1878. Designed by renowned British architect F.W. Stevens, this Victorian Gothic structure, with its domes representing the Indian influence took a good ten years to build. The crowning glory of the CST is the central dome itself which also houses a heritage room. Many of the gargoyles and carvings were done by Lockwood Kipling, a professor from the Sir JJ School of Arts who incidentally was the father of the celebrated British-Indian author, Rudyard Kipling. Even as far back as the 19th century the construction of this mammoth structure cost a whopping 260,000 pounds.</p>
<p>What sets this building apart from many other heritage building is the fact that it’s still serving the same function – i.e. the headquarters of the Central Railway – since the time it was built. It’s little wonder then that the CST which is historically, architecturally and culturally so important made it to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2004. Figuring on the prestigious UNESCO list has heightened the awareness to preserve such historical buildings and also commenced major restoration work.</p>
<p>The Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee has done much work in this regard. “It’s our duty to safeguard these buildings that have been listed on UNESCO after a detailed survey. It’s the owner who is responsible for the maintenance of the buildings; in this case the Central Railway. However, if a certain building requires work, we send a notice to the concerned party,” say Mr. Afzulpurkar, Chairman of the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee. All new structures around the site have to be in harmony with the existing heritage structure.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the CST is one of Mumbai’s landmark buildings but there are equally impressive buildings in the vicinity, a legacy left by the Raj, that have weathered the passage of time along with it. Right opposite the railway station is the Bombay Municipal Corporation Building, ornately embellished with gargoyles and carvings; another creation by F.W. Stevens. Adjacent to this structure is the building that houses Mumbai’s oldest daily, The Times of India. From heads of state of film stars, The Times of India building has played host to many luminaries over the decades.</p>
<p>Within the radius of a few kilometers are many other masterpieces that make up the history of the city – The Gateway of India, The Taj Mahal Hotel, The Prince of Wales Museum (now known as the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya) University Hall &amp; Library, Rajabai Tower and the Asiatic Library to name a few.</p>
<p>Sadly, a number of historical buildings in Mumbai are in various states of disrepair. However, awareness is half the battle won and considerable efforts are being made to restore these works of art to their former glory. Over the decades, Mumbai has earned the moniker of the ‘city that never sleeps.’ But amidst all that buzz, lies a historical and architectural marvel that continues to fascinate all.</p>
