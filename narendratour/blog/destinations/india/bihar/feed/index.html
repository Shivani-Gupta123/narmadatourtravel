Driven by his profound conversion to Buddhism, Ashoka embarked on a mission to disseminate the Buddha&#8217;s teachings across his empire. His pilgrimage to Bodh Gaya culminated in the construction of a stupa marking the spot of Buddha&#8217;s enlightenment.</p>
<p>Over successive centuries, Bodh Gaya flourished as a center of Buddhist pilgrimage and learning, attracting devotees and scholars from far and wide. The present-day Mahabodhi Temple complex evolved through multiple phases of construction and renovation, with contributions from various ruling dynasties, including the Mauryas, Guptas, and Palas.</p>
<p>Despite enduring periods of decline and desecration, Mahabodhi Temple&#8217;s resilience and spiritual significance endured, culminating in its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2002. Today, it stands as a beacon of Buddhist faith and a testament to the enduring legacy of the Enlightened One.</p>
<h3><strong>The Buddha</strong></h3>
<p>Gautama Buddha, the historical figure at the heart of Buddhism, plays a central role in the narrative of Mahabodhi Temple. Born as Siddhartha Gautama in the 6th century BCE, he renounced his princely life in pursuit of spiritual truth. After years of ascetic practice and meditation, he achieved enlightenment while seated under the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya. Renamed the Buddha, or the Enlightened One, he dedicated his life to sharing his insights into the nature of suffering and the path to liberation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An interesting fact about the historical places of India is that the features of such places carry an aura that cannot be matched by the modern construction patterns. No doubt that we have advanced and have reached to new heights of excellence in designing efficient and ergonomic structures, but we still look back at these ancient sites for inspiration. The people who were involved in the construction of these spaces were not as technologically advanced as we are now, yet they have managed to achieve the desired results by putting in their zest for perfection and create one fort that has survived against all odds and is now a popular tourist destination. One classic example of an elegant historical fort is the Rohtasgarh Fort of Bihar.</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong></p>
<p>Rohtasgarh Fort is built in the district of Rohtas. Built over a plateau on the upper course of Son River, the fort is approximately 39 kilometres from sasaram, the administrative headquarters of the district and 45 kilometres from Dehri, another important town in the district.</p>
<h3><strong>History</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-8528 alignright" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Rohtasgarh-Fort.jpg" alt="Rohtasgarh Fort" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>The fort was built by the 36th ruler of the solar dynasty, Raja Harishchandra. The fort was named after Rohitasva, Harishchandra son. Built atop a hill, the fort was a safe and productive heaven with fertile soils and streams that facilitated cultivation. The fort was surrounded by dense forests where wild animals were abundant, thus making it difficult for the robbers and enemies to enter into the fort premises, unless they were very much clever.</p>
<p>The inscriptions at the fort suggest that it was besieged by rulers from different dynasties. The construction of the road from the foothill to the top of the hill and the installation of gates on the ghats, along with the fortification has been credited to the Hindu Kings. Two fortifications are still visible at the fort. The artifacts found were dated back to the period of Sher Shah Suri and other rulers who conquered the fort after him, leaving just a matrix used for producing seals, which are said to be from the reign of Sasanka, who ruled over the region in the seventh century.</p>
<p>The reign of Sher Shah Suri began when he conquered the fort in 1539. His attack at this fort was a measure to gain some foothold after losing the Fort in Chunar to Humayun, a ruler of the Mughal Empire. His was not a direct attack on the fort. Instead, he devised a cunning plan by requesting the ruler of the fort to leave behind his women and children along with the state treasure, as he was busy in a fight in Bengal. He pulled his trick by sending the women and children at first, which made the king believe that the king had been honest. However, the palanquins that arrived after those carried Afghan soldiers, who attacked and captured the fort as the unprepared kings fled away. At the time Sher Shah Suri ruled the fort, he employed 10,000 armed soldiers to guard the fort.</p>
<p>Records point that there were actually 14 gates, out of which 10 were closed after Sher Shah Suri captured the fort. The Jama Masjid built towards the west of the fort had been made by Haibat Khan, a close aide of Sher Shah Suri. The primary material used in the construction of three-domed fort is white sandstone. The construction of this Masjid, where a mausoleum of Sher Shah’s superintendent was established, was completed in 1543.</p>
<p>A major renovation work was carried out during the reign of Raja Man Singh, a ruler of the Kacchwaha Dynasty. The work included renovation of the whole fort, construction of a grand palace and Persian gardens and cleaning of ponds. Post his death, the ownership of the fort was transferred to the Wazir’s office. During the sixteenth century, Jahangir’s son Prince Khurram came to the fort for refuge. The keys of the fort were handed over to him by Saiyaad Mubarak, who was the guardian of the fort during that period. While fighting a battle to conquer Avadh, he again headed to the fort for safety, but lost the battle.</p>
<p>Mir Kasim, who was the Nawab of Bengal and Bihar in the seventeenth century, lost a battle against the British troops and came to the fort for refuge, but could not hide there for long. The Diwan of Rohtas decided to hand over the fort to the British Captain Goddard, who stayed for a period of two months at the fort. During this period, he destroyed the fortifications and the storeroom and left leaving a few guards behind, who abandoned the fort the next year. The fort remained dormant and saw no footfall until 1857, when the First War of Independence was fought. Babu Kunwar Singh’s younger brother Amar Singh and his companions headed to the fort for refuge.</p>
<h3><strong>What to See</strong></h3>
<p>The attractions of the fort are:</p>
<p><strong>Hathiya Pol (Elephant Gate)</strong></p>
<p>This is the largest gate of the fort. Built in 1597, it was named after the designs of the elephants engraved on its walls.</p>
<p><strong>The Aina Mahal (Palace of Mirrors)</strong></p>
<p>The Aina Mahal or the Palace of Mirrors was built by Raja Man Singh. He lived in Takhte Badshahi, which is considered to be the most opulent part of the palace. From the top floor of this four-storeyed structure, you get a bird’s eye view of the surrounding. The women’s quarters are built on the third floor of this structure, where one can reach after passing through the cupola. The second floor houses a gallery and an assembly hall.</p>
<p>Raja Man Singh resided on the first floor and his quarter and the ladies’ room were connected through a gateway. The assembly hall displays intricate designs of flowers and leaves etched on the walls and pillars.</p>
<p><strong>The Hanging House</strong></p>
<p>To the west of the fort, one can see a structure which is not mentioned in any of the records stating its purpose or period of construction. It is named as The Hanging House by the local residents, as it looks like it is hanging at the edge of the cliff.</p>
<p>A legend that locals narrate is that this building leads to a cave where there is a grave of a Muslim fakir. It is said that this fakir was thrown thrice into the valley after his hands and legs were tied. However, he miraculously survived each fall, which led to his burial at the site.</p>
<p><strong>Ganesh Temple</strong></p>
<p>This temple is built at a distance of roughly half a kilometre from the Aina Mahal.</p>
<p><strong>Jama Masjid</strong></p>
<p>The Masjid, Mausoleum of Habsh Khan and Sufi Sultan’s Tomb is as beautiful as it can get. This was amongst the first structures of Bihar built in a Rajputana style. Rohatsan temple was dedicated to Lord Shiva, with the sacred lingam housed in the main mandap. The mandap and the roof of this iconic temple were destroyed, leaving the ruins behind. The idol like the lingam is missing from the Devi Temple, which can be reached by following a series of 84 steps from the ground floor.</p>
<h3><strong>Eat, Drink, Collect</strong></h3>
<p>Meals and beverages are available at the various hotels in the Rohtas city itself. Tourists should include purchasing several utility goods made by the local craftsmen in Rohtas. Imitation jewelry and gift items can also be purchased from these craftsmen at a very reasonable price.</p>
<h3><strong>Best Time to Visit</strong></h3>
<p>Tourists should avoid visiting Rohtasgarh Fort during the monsoons, as the heavy rains can act as a spoilsport and may bring a halt to your pursuit of exploring this place. The temperature soars up to 45 degree in the month of May while it dips down to around 10 degrees in the month of January. Carrying appropriate clothes and accessories according to the time of your visit is thus recommended.</p>
<h3><strong>How to Reach</strong></h3>
<p>The closest airport to Rohtas is the Lok Nayak Jayaprakash International Airport. At a distance of approximately 160 kilometres, this airport in Patna city provides excellent connectivity with cities like Bangalore, Indore,  Gaya Bihar, Mumbai, Pune, Lucknow, Chennai, Kolkata, etc.</p>
<p>The closest railway station is in the city of Aurangabad, at a distance of approximately 37.5 kilometres. Once the tourists reach the Patna Airport/Aurangabad Railway Station, they should hire a taxi to reach to the fort. You can board buses run by state road Transport Corporation from almost all the neighboring cities which run to and from Rohtas.</p>

The region is full of must-see places connected to the life of Lord Buddha. Before you plan your trip to Gaya, go through this travel information guide below to make yourself travel-ready.</p>
<h3><strong>Religious Significance</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Bodh-Gaya.jpg" alt="Bodh-Gaya" width="741" height="486" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5048" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Bodh-Gaya.jpg 741w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Bodh-Gaya-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Bodh-Gaya-170x110.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Bodh-Gaya-168x110.jpg 168w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Bodh-Gaya-370x243.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /><br />
Gaya is the holy seat of three religions; Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism. Many temples line the banks of the Phalgu River which flows in Gaya. Akshayavat and Pipal trees dot the whole town and thousands of women pilgrims come here to visit the shrine of Mangla Gauri. This shrine has two round stones that represent the breasts of Sati; Lord Shiva’s wife. Vishnupad Temple in Gaya is adored alike by Hindus and Buddhists.</p>
<p>Gaya is very important to devout Hindus from the perspective of salvation as Lord Rama came to Gaya with Sita for Pind Daan. When Rama went to bathe before offering Pinda Dhanam; Devi Sita saw a vision of Dasharatha who told her to offer the Pindam as he was feeling very hungry. Devi Sita compiled but this angered Rama when he came back. It was then that Phalgu river, Branhmin, Banyan Tree and cow were called by Sita to validate her story. Apart from the Banyan tree everyone denied supporting Sita. Sita cursed the Phalgu River which then lost its water and became a stretch os mere sand dunes. At the same time the Banyan tree was blessed to become evergreen and immortal.</p>
<p>According to Jainism 22 out of 24 Tirthankars attained immortal salvation in Gaya and this is why Gaya is very important to the Jain followers. Jain pilgrimage Pawapuri where Mahavira attained Moksha is also reachable from Gaya. Gaya Jain temple is very beautiful with a huge idol of Bhagwan Chandraprabhu in it. Parasnath Hills in Gaya is also an important spiritual destination.</p>
<p>For Buddhists, the Brahmayoni hills where Gautam Buddha preached the immortal Fire Sermon to one thousand saints, holds a special significance. All the fire serving saints attained enlightenment post the sermon and the hill was christened as Gayasisa.</p>

<h3><strong>Ancient History</strong></h3>
<p>The earliest known history of Gaya concerns the enlightenment of Gautam Buddha. Just 10 km away from Gaya town is Bodh Gaya where Buddha attained immortality. Since then the areas like Nalanda and Vaishali near Gaya became centers for spiritual discourses and pursuit of knowledge. These areas grew in importance under Mauryan rule. Gaya was originally an important part of Magadh.</p>
<h3><strong>Modern History</strong></h3>
<p>Gaya in early 1810 AD had two distinct parts; Gaya and Allahabad. While Gaya was dominated by priests, lawyers and traders stayed in Allahabad. Bihar Vibhuti awardee and the first C.M cum Finance Minister of India Dr. Anugrah Narayan Sinha was from Gaya. Swami Sahajanand Saraswati who was a thought leader and creator of Kisan Andolan also lived in Gaya. Gaya quickly became an important place of politics in the pre independence era. Indian Congress leaders used to visit Gaya frequently to talk to Kisan Andolan leaders. During the struggle for Indian Independence, the All India Session of Congress was conducted under leadership of Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das in the year 1922. Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru and Maulana Azad all attended political sessions in Gaya. Ishwar Chaudhuri, Jeetan Ram Manjhi and other political luminaries also hailed from the Gaya district.</p>
<p>Gaya officially established itself in the year 1865 as it was a part of Ramgarh district in Bihar till 1864. In May 1981 the division of Magadh was established by Bihar Government comprising of Gaya and other towns. Gaya district currently occupies 1921 square meters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Spiritual Sojourns</strong></h3>
<p>The centre of the Buddhist Universe, Bodh Gaya helps one understand the message of the enlightened one.</p>
<p>We stood amid the ruins of an ancient Stupa that rested like a crumpled crown on the summit of a little mound that overlooked the dry Falgu River. And as dusk cast its veil like a soothing balm over the sun-scorched land, the sand of the riverbed started to glow with an almost mysterious golden-yellow hue. A little shrine perched on the banks of the river was bathed in fluorescent light and shimmered like a beacon for souls lost in the vast sea of sand.</p>
<p>Popular legend has it that this shrine stands on the very spot where Prince Siddhartha bid farewell to the five disciples who had accompanied him through his six years of penance and meditation. Dejected by the fact that he had still not unlocked the mysteries of life and human suffering, he pleaded with them to leave him alone. Soon after they had departed, the young prince sat down for his first meal in six years, offered to him by an old lady who lived in a hut close by. He then crossed the sandy stretch, a frail skeleton-like figure trudging across the barren riverbed to the forest on the other side.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3259" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Bodh-Gaya.jpg" alt="Bodh Gaya" width="741" height="486" /><br />
That night as Prince Siddhartha mediated on a bundle of straw under a bodhi tree the earth heaved and a slab of polished stone emerged directly under him. And that night he attained enlightenment and was reborn as Lord Buddha. Today, the forest has been transformed into a sprawling temple complex around which the pilgrim town of Bodh Gaya and indeed the entire world revolves. For Bodh Gaya is the centre of the earth… or so Buddhists believe; for it is here that the religion traces its origins.</p>
<p>The Mahabodhi Temple Complex (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) comprises manicured gardens and shrines that surround the towering Stupa within which is the larger-than-life gilded statue of the Buddha. We looked at the bejeweled sage and could not help but muse on the paradox that he was being showered with the earthly treasure that he had renounced in his life. That was till we saw a group f devotees, elderly men and women, walk past in single file. The simple unquestioning devotion that radiated from eyes that gazed out of their parched ad wrinkled faces was a fitting rebuttal to our skepticism.</p>
<p>We lowered our cameras and meditated on the Buddha and his message. For a brief moment, we were cocooned in a void, away from the hustle and bustle of pilgrim around us… indeed, the world itself seemed to go into a prolonged spasm as we felt the Buddha reach out through the centuries and touch us. The moment of infinity was brief before we were dragged back once more to the raucous reality of the pilgrims around us.</p>
<p>We joined the river of pilgrims as they circled the main stupa, stopping to offer prayers and seek the blessing of the Lord at the number of smaller shrines and gilded statues that grace the complex. After admiring the bodhi tree under which Lord Buddha attained spiritual liberation (the one today is believed to have sprung from the roots of the original tree), we set off to explore the town which was studded with monasteries that reflected the architectural flair of the nations that built them: Japan, China, Thailand, Tibet, Sri Lanka…. Indeed, they gave Bodh Gaya the feel of a miniature global village them park. Our final stop was at the giant 80 ft Japanese statue of the Buddha before we retired for the night. Yes, Bodh Gaya was our first stop on a spiritual journey that traced the footsteps of the Buddha as he progressed from birth in Lumbini across the border in Nepal to Kushinagar where he discarded his earthly body and attained Mahaparinirvan. In many ways it was an awakening of sorts: our personal journey of enlightenment.</p>
<h4><strong>On the Buddhist Trail</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The Mahaparinirvan Special Train, run by Indian Railways stops at the most important places on the Buddhist pilgrim circuit as it chugs across the plains of Central India.</li>
<li>The eight-day / seven-night journey which starts and ends in  Gaya Bihar covers the four main sites that are a must on any in-the-footsteps-of-the-Buddha itinerary: Lumbini where Buddha was born, Bodh Gaya where he attained enlightenment, Shravasti where he spent 25 of the 45 monsoon seasons after enlightenment and Kushinagar where he discarded his earthly body.</li>
<li>It also includes a number of other Buddhist pilgrim sites as well as the Hindu pilgrim town of Varanasi and Agra, the home of the Taj Mahal.</li>
