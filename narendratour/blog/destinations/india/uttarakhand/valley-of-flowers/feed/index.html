<p>The region was unchartered and not even known for all the natural gems hidden in it before the botanist Frank Smith discovered it and was spellbound by its enchanting floral view. In 1982, Valley of Flowers was announced as World Heritage Site plus National Park. UNESCO recognized this vale as ‘Heritage’ because it was discovered that some very vital medicinal herbs grow naturally in the Valley of Flowers. We can relate this fact to the myths easily. According to Hindu mythology, Hanuman Ji picked the Sanjeevani Booti from this very region to save the life of Lakshmana who received fatal wounds at a battlefield.</p>
<p>The flowers that bloom in the ‘Valley of Flowers’ belong to some of the rarest species and the most renowned ones are Cobra Lily, Brahma Kapal, Blue Poppy. It is indeed wondrous to find such a floral valley at a height of some 3600 meters from sea level. So flower lovers and botanists leave no stone unturned to reach the Valley of Flowers and witness its panoramic floral splendor.</p>

From  Gaya Bihar you need to cover 505 kms to reach Govindghat. Well-developed road transports like buses, taxis are available to make enthusiasts reach Govindghat comfortably and then your 17 kms of the unique trek starts. The location of Govindghat on NH58 makes it easily reachable by road transport. It is connected via road transport to all key Uttarakhand destinations such as Ukhimath, Rishikesh, Karnaprayag, Rudraprayag, and Chamoli. If you wish to come by flight, then you can fly from  Gaya Bihar airport to land at the Jolly Grant Airport and thereafter avail road transport to reach Govindghat.
