<h3><strong>Best Time to Visit</strong></h3>
<p>Choosing the optimal time to undertake the Badrinath Kedarnath Yatra is essential for a memorable and spiritually uplifting experience. The best time to visit these sacred shrines is during the summer months of May to June and the autumn months of September to October. During these periods, the weather is pleasant, and the yatra routes are generally open for pilgrims. However, it&#8217;s advisable to avoid the monsoon season (July to August) due to heavy rainfall and the risk of landslides, which may disrupt travel plans.</p>
<h3><strong>Best Time for Darshan</strong></h3>
<p>To ensure a serene and unhurried darshan experience at the Badrinath and Kedarnath temples, pilgrims are advised to visit during the early morning hours or late evening when crowds are relatively sparse. Arriving before the scheduled opening time of the temples allows devotees to avoid long queues and have ample time for prayers and meditation in the sacred ambiance of the shrines.</p>
<h3><strong>Opening Dates of Temples</strong></h3>
<p>The opening dates of the Badrinath and Kedarnath temples vary each year and are determined based on Hindu calendar calculations. Generally, the temples open their doors to devotees around late April or early May and remain accessible until the end of October or early November. It&#8217;s recommended to verify the exact opening dates for the current year through official temple websites or local authorities before planning your yatra.</p>
