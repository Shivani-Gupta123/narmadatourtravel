										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Please be a traveller, not a tourist. Try new things, meet new people, and look beyond what’s right in front of you. Those are the keys to understanding this amazing world we live in.” &#8211; Andrew Zimmern.</p>
<p>So true this is and yet only few manage to look beyond normal travel routines and discover places, people and food; taste real adventure. In today’s fast-paced world, people have less time to travel and even lesser time to actually explore new places which can enhance their experiences. And going beyond the usual sometimes makes all the difference between a traveller and a tourist. Tourists travelling to Leh Ladakh by air arrive at Leh which offers the first glimpse of Ladakh. The usual itinerary comprises popular sites like Khardung La, Nubra Valley and Pangong Tso, but there are host of other places which can offer uniqueness and sense of discovery to the traveller. So here is a list of such places for all you adventurous people and will bring out the traveller in you.</p>
<p><strong>01. Turtuk (210 Kms from Leh)</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Turtuk-Village-Leh.jpg" alt="Turtuk Village Leh" width="700" height="417" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3948" /><br />
Tucked in a corner towards Line of Control is this beautiful, peaceful and colourful village named Turtuk. It is the last point in Shyok Valley and 85 KM from Hundar. Shyok River follows you throughout your journey and offers some great and magnificent locations which will stay in your memory forever. The valley concisely tapers near tiny Changmar village after which the real changes start. Till 1971, Turtuk was part of Baltisan (now in Pakistan) which became part of India after the war. Culturally you will find Buddhists and Muslim-Balti but the inhabitants are originally of Buddhism religion which is the pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet. In the 8th century they were converted to Tibetan Buddhism and subsequently in Islam in the 13th century. There are 2 areas the Upper and the lower Turtuk both different scenically.</p>
<p><strong>02. Dah Hanu (The Land of Aryans) (165 Kms from Leh)</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Dha-Hanu-Village.jpg" alt="Dha Hanu Village" width="700" height="395" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3946" /><br />
The villages of Dah and Hanu are situated to the northwest of the town of Leh towards Lamayuru. One of the major attractions of Dah &amp; Hanu is to meet people of Brogpa or Dard community. They are ethnically distinct from the rest of Ladakhis and they believe that they are a pure Aryan race which migrated from Europe about 1000 years ago. The language spoken within the community is Brogskad which is quite different from Ladakhi. Brogpa means mountain dwellers and their culture can be seen in a local festival Bona Na. Their ancient traditions and way of life are partly preserved through their songs, festivals and hymns. The location itself is extremely beautiful with the colorful flowers all over the village gardens overlooking the turquoise river Indus and golden Barley fields. It is a view that remains etched forever…</p>
<p><strong>03. Chilling (60 Kms from Leh)</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chilling-Leh.jpg" alt="Chilling Leh" width="700" height="447" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3944" /><br />
This is a quaint and hidden village where some of the famous treks in Markha and Zanskar valley either start or end. And I must tell you this is one of best small rides I have had in and around Leh. You can really feel the remoteness and experience some mind blowing views of the valley. It is extremely beautiful with Zanskar River flowing by your side, small and even smaller settlements, colour changing mountains and warm people. I can bet you would think and rethink before going back to your mundane lives. It definitely makes to our top 5 lists very comfortably.</p>
<p><strong>04. Hanle (255 Kms from Leh)</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Hanle-Leh.jpg" alt="Hanle Leh" width="700" height="437" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3947" /><br />
This is a village in Changthang region and is notably the southernmost part of Ladakh. It is serene, calm, enchanting and is best for people who want to feel nothingness, vastness and awe amongst the majestic and pristine Himalayas. It is also home to Hanle or Analy Gompa of 17th century which belongs to a branch of Tibetan Buddhism. Hanle is known for its Indian Astronomical Observatory and it is now being equipped with Major Atmosphere Cherenkov Experiment (MACE) gamma-ray telescope being built here will be the world’s largest telescope at the highest altitude and the second largest gamma-ray telescope in the world. So all those astronomical guys out there, this is the place to be next season</p>
<p><strong>05. Chushul (210 Kms from Leh)</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chushul-Leh.jpg" alt="Chushul Leh" width="700" height="437" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3945" /><br />
It is another village in the Changthang region which is close to Pangong Lake. Home to beautiful salt marshes where you get to see Black Necked Cranes, an endangered species which migrate here every year. This is the place where fierce army battle has taken place in 1962 with Chinese army and our heroes once again proved their mettle. Nearby there are awesome views to follow including Mirpal Tso, another beautiful lake. You can also see the Spangur Gap which is a mountain pass on the Line of Actual Control from where a lake and Chinese territory is also visible. Bring on the respect for army by visiting the War Memorial and pay your salute as well. We have marked these locations for you in a map.</p>
<p>Even though we have just covered 5, Ladakh has many tiny, quaint and pristine locations and have a lot to offer for both travellers and tourists. The green oasis in such raw and unforgiving cold desert brings a different hue to our mind and thoughts. The only fact that still surprises me is how people have survived and have learnt to live with very little and still remain content and happy. The Land of High Passes is barren yet amazingly beautiful, poor yet culturally rich, distant yet feels friendly, similar yet contrastingly diverse, harsh yet soulful calming.</p>
<p>They say “the travel never ends but the road does”. So explore more, keep riding, be safe and do visit the one and only Leh Ladakh.		</p>

A mud side path from the highway leads to a side valley and after crossing a ford, you enter the complex of Basgo Gompa known to the Tibetans as the ‘Divine Peak of Great Stability’. This complex comprises of the Basgo citadel or fortress and three temples. These were built by the Tibetan king Gragspabum and his descendants in the 16th and 17th centuries, though some historians argue that the fortress existed much earlier.</p>
<p>What is left amidst the ruins of the fortress is a long lower wall with the remains of shelters for animals and broken yet majestic towers. A lack of written history has been instrumental in lending a lot of mystery to this elusive mud-brick fortress.</p>
<p>The three mud-brick temples located inside the rammed earth walls of the fortress are dedicated to Maitreya Buddha &#8211; the fifth incarnation of Sakyamuni, who is also popularly known as ‘Future Buddha.’ These buildings seem very austere from the outside, but rich and colorful murals adorn the interior walls showcasing vignettes from the life of Buddha; some showing Padmasambhava, Sakyamuni and other Buddhist deities in meditative moods.</p>
<p>The largest of these temples is Chamba Lhakhang built atop the hill and can only be accessed through a set of steep stairs. You get the most excellent views of Basgo village and the entire ruin complex from here. It holds a 14 meter high, gilded statue of the Maitreya Buddha. Some people believe that the ancient fortress were not built by the Tibetan king, but by Jamyang Namgyal and it was his son, Singge who built this two-storey high golden copper-gilded statue in the memory of his father. This temple also is home to some of the most extraordinary celestial paintings of the heavens and heavenly bodies.</p>
<p>The second temple, Serzing Lhakhang is lower down the hill and is older than the first one. It is very dark inside, and along with another statue of Buddha, there are cabinets containing holy books and some of the scripts here in this room are written in gold, copper and silver letters.</p>
<p>The third and smallest temple, Chan Chung is at the bottom of the hill and is the ideal place for taking pictures of the adjacent fields and villages. The chief colours in this temple are dark blues and reds making it very dark inside; it also contains a huge statue of Buddha flanked by murals of protector gods on the walls.</p>
<p>Inspite of being such a rich and beautiful historical site, Basgo Gompa receives very few visitors which is a shame because tourists running after the popular well-known places to see in Ladakh are missing out on a unique and one-of-its-kind experience of this Basgo Gompa legendary murals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Amarnath caves, dedicated to Hindu Lord Shiva &#8211; a sanctifier and supporter of good and destructor of evil, are 5,000 years old shrines in the northernmost state of Jammu and Kashmir in India. Within the cave, Lord Shiva is resembled in the form of an ice stalagmite, the Shivling. In this word, Ling has been derived from two words namely Leen meaning to dissolve and Gati meaning to grow. Therefore, the meaning of the word Shivling is that the man should stay dissolved (Leen) in the Lord Shiva and then he should grow (Gati).</p>
<p>The miraculous ice pillar grows on its own during May to August and then slowly wanes, which is according to the moon’s phases. There is around four to five ice formation among which that of the Shiva is the highest. To his left is that of his son &#8211; Lord Ganesha ((the Lord of Wisdom and Prosperity)), while on the right is that the Parvati, Shiva’s wife, and Bhairava (God of Courage).<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1868" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Amarnath-Cave.jpg" alt="Amarnath Cave" width="700" height="477" /><br />
Located at 145 km away from Srinagar, the cave is at a height of 3,888 m above the sea level. Due to this geographical location and unfriendly weather, the route to this holy cave is unreachable from September to June due to snow covers. Therefore, the Amarnath pilgrimage from Srinagar or Kashmir is only permitted from the period of July to August. Even after this, the route is arduous and the peak’s height and low temperature can make it further tough. However, this has not affected the people’s faith due to their unflinching devotion and belief in Lord Shiva.</p>
<p>Due to terrorists, the Central Reserve Police Force, Indian Army, and Indian Paramilitary Forces have tightened the security due to which prior permission for pilgrimage is required from the Government of India.</p>
<h3><strong>Discovery of the Divine Cave</strong></h3>
<p>There is a mysterious story behind the discovery of this cave. According to this story, a Sadhu (saint) gave a sack of coal to a Gujjar (type of tribe) shepherd named Buta Malik. Amazingly, instead of coal, the shepherd found gold coins in the sack when he opened it. In no limit to his happiness, the shepherd went back quickly to thank the Sadhu. However, when he reached place where he met the Sadhu, the Sadhu had disappeared and instead, he found the divine cave and the sanctified lingam. He publicized this event to all the villagers and from then, the cave is revered as the sacred shrine of Shiva.</p>
<p>There is another story to this discovery according to the ancient epics. According to this story, the current valley of Kashmir was actually a big lake in olden days. Kashyap Rishi, the grandson of Lord Brahma (creator/father of the Universe), drained the lake water via multiple rivers and streams. At this time, Bhrigu Rishi had come to visit the Himalayas. This sage was the first to worship the Holy Cave. He then told about this lingam to the people. Since then, Amarnath is regarded as Shiva’s abode and lakhs of devotees come for pilgrimage despite arduous terrain for obtaining eternal peace and joy.</p>
<p><strong>Legend</strong></p>
<p>There are two legends famous behind the significance of this holy cave.</p>
<p><strong>Story-telling Legend</strong></p>
<p>Considering the Hindu mythology, it was in this holy cave where Shiva revealed to his divine wife, the top secret of life and eternity. Crores of years ago, Goddess Parvati asked Lord Shiv – Bhole Shankar, her divine companion, to explain the reason of wearing the beads of heads (Mund Mala). Shiva answered that whenever you take birth, I insert one more head in my mala. Then, the goddess said, “My Lord, my body is destroyed every time and I die again and again, but you are immortal. Please let me know the secret of this.” As a reply, Lord Shiva said that this happens due to Amar Katha.</p>
<p>Maa Parvati insisted for the life’s secret repeatedly. However, Lord Shiva continued to postpone it for a long time. Lastly, on persistent request, he decided to reveal the immortal truth. To tell the truth, Lord Shiva began to look for a lonely place where no living being can heed the immortal tale. In his quench, Lord Shiva chooses the Amarnath Cave. He began his journey towards the cave. On the way, at Pahalgam (Bail Gaon), he left his Nandi, the bull for his ride. Next, at Chandanwari, he took out the Moon from his locks (Jataon). Going further, at the banks of Lake Sheshnag, he took out his snakes usually found around his neck. Then, he left his son Ganesha at the Mahagunas Parvat (Mahaganesh Hill).</p>
<p>Next, at Panjtarni, Lord Shiva left the Five Elements from which a living being is made up of namely, Earth, Water, Air, Fire, and Sky. He is regarded as the God of these elements. A popular belief is that both Lord Shiva and Maa Parvati performed a Tandav dance to commemorate sacrificing the materialistic world. After making himself free from all the worldly things, both divine souls entered the holy Amarnath cave.</p>
<p>Then, Lord Shiva took Samadhi on the skin of the Deer and began to meditate. Next, he ordered Rudra named Kalagni to lit fire to discard any living being in or nearby the cave so that no living being can hear this tale. It was now that he started explaining the reason behind the creation of life and this world to Maa Parvati. However, by chance, one egg was underlying the skin.</p>
<p>While Shiva was explaining this to Parvati, unknown to them, two mating doves from this egg eavesdropped in between to learn the secret and tend to dwell in the cave forever. These doves are reborn again and again and have made the cave their perpetual home. Many pilgrims on their way have seen and reported the doves-pair despite no vegetation being around the cave. This is truly an unbelievable miraculous truth in the history of this cave. Even today, you can see these two doves when you trek for pilgrimage in August.</p>
<h3><strong>Nectar Distribution Legend</strong></h3>
<p>There is another popular legend behind this cave. According to the legend, Lord Shiva gave the celestial nectar of immortality to all the heavenly gods to make them immortal. This act of Shiva bought him an award of the name Amarnath, which means one who is eternal and immortal. Since then, Lord Shiva also means Lord of Immortality and hence the cave dedicated to him.</p>
<h3><strong>Amarnath Yatra Route Map</strong></h3>
<p>There are two routes to this cave. One is the traditional route from Pahalgam and the other is from Baltal.</p>
<p><strong>The Pahalgam Route</strong></p>
<p>From Pahalgam, the cave is at 46 km at the end of the Lidder valley. Actually, it used to start from Srinagar that is 117 km away, but now a shorter route is taken through Chandanwari. Prior to the Journey, a puja (religious ritual) is performed at the Shankaracharya temple in Srinagar from where the pilgrims take a rod (mace) named Chhari Mubarak up to the cave.</p>
<p>Trekking is the only way to reach the cave. The trek from Chandanwari holds spiritual importance. You will come across the following halts or beautiful scenes.</p>
<p><strong>Sheshnag</strong></p>
<p>Is a mountain of seven peaks looking like a head of a snake? Other attractions are the glaciers and lakes.</p>
<p><strong>Mahagunas Pass</strong></p>
<p>This is at 12 km that goes down to the next stop.</p>
<p><strong>Panchtarni</strong></p>
<p>This is the last camp of grasslands from which the cave is at 6 km.</p>
<p>It is recommended to start early due to long distance and queues of people in Darshan. If you do so, you can return to Panchtarni by lunch and Sheshnag by night. If you are a dedicated devotee with an immense sea of faith within you, this holy pilgrimage journey will definitely prove fulfilling to you.</p>
<p><strong>The Baltal Route</strong></p>
<p>This is an isolated area and it is for those who do not want crowd. Baltal is a village in the foot of Zojila Pass at a distance of 15 km from Sonamarg. However, this route is steep and is slippery during the visiting time in August or monsoons. It takes a day to reach the cave via this route and so there are many teal stalls and Langar (big kitchens) at Brarimarg, Sangam top, and Do mail. The rout at the Sangam top coincides with the Pahalgam route.</p>
<p>You can take up a pony ride to reach the cave available at the standard rates.</p>
<p><strong>Days of Attraction</strong></p>
<p>When the ice Shivling is at its peak on the full moon day in August (Hindu holy month of Shravan), lakhs of Hindus and other tourists reach the cave to worship the amazing lingam by trekking from Pahalgam.</p>

Kashmir is popular among tourists for its scenic locations and Kargil is no different. It is located in the region of Ladakh and is the 2nd largest town over there. Kargil lies on the boundary in the border that joins Pakistan. The location of Kargil is in sync with its name as it is sandwiched at the intersection point of two countries.

<p>Draped in style by the fascinating Himalayan mountain range, at an altitude of 3,400m above sea level, en route to Srinagar, lies the beautiful Drass valley. It is located 60 kms to the west of Kargil district, at the entrance to Ladakh, the land of passes. The town comes second (first in India) in the list of coldest places on earth where human civilization exists. The temperature over here drops down to as low as -40 degrees during winter, while summers are cool. The summer months are accompanied by frequent soft drizzles as well which make the climate all the more pleasant. It is during this time of the year the Drass valley attracts the mountaineers and trekkers who love to indulge into adventures, the most. Over the years the place has come up as an important tourist destination of the country.</p>
<h3><strong>How to Reach Drass:</strong></h3>
<p>One can travel by road, rail or air in order to reach Drass, however, flight or train would take you only to the nearest cities. The airport closest to the Drass valley is Leh, the capital city of Ladakh district while the rail station that is at close quarters to the beautiful valley town is Jammu. However, there are buses running back and forth from Srinagar to Leh or Kargil through NH1 which drop by Drass on its way. The usual halt time for buses is about 10 minutes. Such busses are available from morning till afternoon. However many get cancelled due to bad weather and other similar reasons. Another option to reach Drass is to avail Jeep or other cars. Best option for single travelers or those who opt for trekking is to avail shared cabs. If you are travelling in a group (say consisting of 7-8 heads) it is better to hire a cab or a car and set out for the journey to Drass.</p>
<p>An important point to remember: Travelers heading to Ladakh from Srinagar are needed to book their names at the Tourist Registration center in Drass.</p>
<p><strong>Places to Stay:</strong></p>
<p>The primary place of accommodation at this place is the government tourist lodge which hosts a varied range of rooms, from suites or deluxe rooms to executive or economical ones. Since hotel options isn’t much over here so a wise decision would be to book the rooms prior to your reaching the place. Rooms can be booked from the tourist registration center at Kargil. However, apart from this government run tourist lodge, a few other private hotels have also come up the valley in recent times.</p>
<p><strong>Sneak Peek into the small town of Drass</strong></p>
<p>Visitors entering the town would be welcomed by a signboard that stands as a proof of the fact that Drass is the second coldest place on earth. The main town caps a distance of not more than 150 meters along the rugged terrain and highways. There are brightly colored wooden and brick houses, not much big, which stand on both sides of the narrow roads. Also, there is a fairly big mosque in the town where the local people offer their prayer. Apart from this, Drass hosts a number of monasteries and there is a common market place for people to buy stuffs for their regular use. Strolling along the roads is the best option if you want to take a tour across the town.</p>
<p><strong>Eating options:</strong></p>
<p>There are several hotels and dhabas over here where your pocket pinch won’t be much. Dry foods such as biscuits, fruits or the sponge cakes which is a specialty of the place are a must have if you are visiting Drass. Pure vegetarian dhabas are also available here.</p>
<h4><strong>Tourist Attractions:</strong></h4>
<p>The Drass valley is well acclaimed as a trekking zone for the mountaineers. If you are a pro and want to dive deep and lose yourself amidst all the adventures, opt for the long treks that Drass offers you. For the young guns who want to get a taste of risk in unexpected undertakings, short trek is a good option. One of the most sought after trekking option is the one from Drass to Suru valley. One gets a prefect view of the picturesque highland villages in course of the trek. On the way falls the Umbala Pass which is a major tourist attraction. The place is covered by lush meadows with beautiful flowers on both sides of the pass, which make it look all the more attractive. The trekking takes 3 days to get completed and can be one heck of an adventure particularly if you are coming with a large group of people. It is pretty demanding to complete this trekking and requires a lot of physical toughness in you. Another trekking option is the famous 3 days long trek to the holy Gumpha of Amarnath.</p>
<p><strong>Zoji La:</strong> The word ‘La’ means pass. One prime tourist attraction over here is the Zoji La. It is from the base of the Zoji la that the Drass valley starts. This pass is well known as the Himalayan entrance to Ladakh. Over the years, the local residents of the place are bearing with the hardships during winter and travel to and fro the Zoji La even during the snow cladded wintry months to facilitate trade. They also help in transportation of goods and assist travelers to cross the pass.</p>
<p><strong>Puga Valley:</strong> This lake basin close to the Drass valley, located across the Polokonka pass, is notable for its hot water spring and Borax and Sulphur sediments. Every year hundreds of tourists and travelers take bath in the water of Puga hot water spring as the spring is considered to have medicinal value. Patients suffering from rheumatism and various skin ailments clean themselves in the water of this basin in order to cure their diseases. There are a lot of travelers who visit the place for this purpose ending up with positive results as well.</p>
<p>Drass had managed to get much bigger attention worldwide. This is due to the wide broadcasting that was done there during the Lo C issues between India and Pakistan. This has put Drass into the folklore of Indian history. The beauty of the place and the locales here are stunning beyond words. The experience of being at Drass is much beyond a normal tourist spot trip considering the importance of the location. Enjoy the bliss of Drass along with its scenic locations and historical spots with your friends or family whenever you get.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mystic land of Ladakh has lots to offer to a tourist. Explore its craggy topography kissing the sky, the green sprawling vales, the pellucid lakes of crystal-clear blue water and you’ll indeed feel you have arrived at a land detached from the chaos of the surrounding world. Read on to learn about Ladakh’s top 10 tourist destinations.</p>
<p>Ladakh is a mystical and mysterious land and is meant for the discerning tourist who is jaded of the overcrowded usual tourist routes and wants to sample the exquisite untouched beauty of the land of Monasteries; Ladakh. To explore Ladakh well you need a minimum of 15 days as there are innumerable places of interest which are pretty inaccessible and require a lot of time to travel. However if you are short on time but still would like to see the principal attractions of Ladakh then the Top 10 Tourist Destinations in Ladakh are shortlisted for you.</p>
<h3><strong>Tourist Attractions in Leh-Ladakh</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Leh: The Capital town of Ladakh</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-754" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Leh-Town-e1411823078568.jpg" alt="Leh Town" width="700" height="300" /><br />
You will anyway be visiting the town of Leh as the only airport in Ladakh lies here. This is an ancient mystical town full of opportunities for sightseeing and shopping. Visit the Namgyal Peak which was the victory peak for the Namgyal Monarchs who ruled over Leh for centuries. The Stok Palace and the Leh Palace are the places in which the Ladakh Monarchs used to stay. The Tsemo Gompa with its intricate paintings and huge Thangka is also an unmissable attraction of the town and so is the smaller Avalokiteshvara Monastery just below it.</p>
<p>The Leh Bazaar is ideal for a shopping expedition (you won’t find much of shopping opportunities in rest of Ladakh). The top buys here are silver artifacts, chunky Tibetan jewelry, Pashmina shawls, Prayer Wheels and Thangkas. Book a vehicle (preferably a Jeep) if you want to see the rest of the Ladakh well because Leh is where all tourists make conveyance arrangements too.</p>
<p><strong>Pangong Tso Lake in Ladakh</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4556" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pangong-Tso-Lake.jpg" alt="Pangong Tso Lake" width="700" height="422" /><br />
The Pangong Tso Lake is unlike anything that you have seen in the rest of your life. For starters it’s an exhilarating but difficult journey as you have to cross the Chang La which is supposed to be the third highest motor able road in the world and you will have to climb to an altitude of 17,500 feet to reach there. The view is astounding and you will scarcely be able to put the camera away. Pangong is actually an army outpost besides which lies the huge Pangong Tso lake; the most beautiful Lake in Ladakh. If you are in Ladakh during winters then it’s possible to have a “walking on water experience as the Lake solidifies to ice. During summers you will be able to see robins, pelicans and red breasted cuckoos flying over the lake. There are an amazing range of flowers which grow right beside the lake making it an amazing experience.</p>
<p><strong>Zanskar Valley in Ladakh</strong></p>
<p>Zanskar Valley is about 5 hours from Leh and its better to ride up there by car as there are lots of places of interest here. This is called the Virgin Valley because of the unspool innocence of the landscape. If you are interested in adventure sports then you will enjoy the white water rafting trip from Zanskar to Phey village.</p>
<p>The Bardan Gompa and the Karsha Monasteries are the two famous monasteries of Zanskar Valley. 100 different Buddha incarnations are depicted in the Karsha Monastery which is situated right beside the beautiful Doda River. Padum village with its crooked little houses with rose and apricot gardens and the lovely Khar palace is also a must see attraction here.</p>
<p><strong>Nubra Valley: Paradise in Ladakh</strong><br />
Caravans of merchants used to carry spices, silk and condiments along the famous Silk Route of which Nubra Valley was a major stop. For an authentic experience ditch your car for half an hour and hitch a ride atop the 2 humped Bactrian Camels that are found on hire there.</p>
<p>If you feel uncomfortable maneuvering the unnaturally high altitude and extreme temperature of Ladakh then Nubra Valley will provide you with a breath of fresh air. For starters the altitude is lower here and you will have a break from the rarified atmosphere in the rest of Ladakh. This is the most beautiful area in Ladakh and takes 5 hours by Jeep from Leh.</p>
<p>The Diskit Monastery is the biggest Monastery in this area with gleaming Chortens, Mani walls, Thangkas and carved Tibetan inscriptions. Diskit Village has lots of shops (in case shopping fever has hit you) and plenty of good restaurants serving world cuisine.</p>
<p><strong>Brokpa Villages of Ladakh</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-758" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Brokpa-Villages.jpg" alt="Brokpa Villages" width="640" height="429" /><br />
If anthropology and culture fascinates you then the Dha and Baigdandu Villages which are a part of the cluster of Brokpa Villages will fascinate you. Centuries ago when Alexander the Great along with his magnificent army had conquered the rest of the world before being demoralized and turning back at the frontiers of Ladakh; some soldiers of his army stayed back. The soldiers were enchanted with the loveliness of the land and being too tired to travel all the way back, they married local beauties and opened inns, pubs, bookshops and hotels here. There is complete prevalence of European culture here with dating, open relationships and independent existence being the norm. Sample the local pancakes and honey, look at the apricot and cherry orchards and see the villagers dressed up in the red feather and bead costumes dance; it’s an experience of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Incidentally, these villages are nearer to Srinagar Airport (5 hours) than the Leh Airport (8.5 hours).</p>
<p><strong>Sumur Nubra Sand Dune Park in Ladakh</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-762" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nubra-Sand-Dune-Park.jpg" alt="Nubra Sand Dune Park" width="640" height="425" /><br />
Sumoor Nubra is India’s only cold desert park. It’s about -6 hours from Leh Airport and is reachable by Jeep or Volvo Bus both of which you can avail from Leh. Once you reach the Sand Dune leisure Park, make sure you attempt the Bactrian two humped camel ride across the park premises. This camel is peculiar only to this region and you will feel like a nomad experiencing the charms of the desert. Mountain climbing is done on the rocky mountain and there are opportunities of biking too. Overnight camp stay in full A.C tent with excellent food, wine, music and cultural programs is arranged by the Sumoor Nubra management.</p>
<p><strong>Uleytokpo: Monastery Village in Ladakh</strong><br />
Uleytokpo besides being one of the prettiest villages in Ladakh is home to 3 of Ladakh’s famous Monasteries; Alchi, Lamayuru and Rizdong. The luxury Uley Resort is situated over here which offers the last word in exotic comfort amidst picturesque surroundings.</p>
<p>Alchi Monastery has 4 main areas of interest; Rinchen Zangpo monument, Chortens, Dukhang (prayer hall) and Manjushri Temple. Don’t forget to visit the Mangyu, Shakyamuni and Vairocana temple complex nearby. Lamayuru Monastery which is one off oldest monasteries in Ladakh shouldn’t be missed.</p>
<p><strong>Confluence of Zanskar and Indus Rivers</strong><br />
The confluence of the Zanskar and Indus River is one of the most beautiful places in Ladakh. The waters of the Indus and Zanskar are distinguishable by the different strains of blue coloring. Many adventure tours and travel organizers set up camps at this point. If you visit this place between July to September you can participate in the river rafting activities which are a thrilling experience in themselves. Fishing, Bird watching and photography are the other major activities here. Ladakh is home to more than 50 varieties of birds many of which are now endangered like Golden Eagle.</p>
<p><strong>Magnetic Hills in Ladakh</strong><br />
People from all across the world come to see the famous Magnetic Hill in Ladakh which defies gravity. Just leave the park in neutral gear and watch it climb uphill at a speed of 10 km per hour on its own. This place is the only area in the world where vehicles climb up a hill even when engine is turned off. This is because the Hill has special magnetic properties. The Magnetic Hill is 30 km away from the capital town of Leh and is one of the most curious places in Ladakh.</p>
<p><strong>Hemis National Park in Ladakh</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-761" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Hemis-National-Park-in-Ladakh1.jpg" alt="Hemis National Park in Ladakh" width="600" height="450" /><br />
The strangest thing about Ladakh is that there are no parks except the Hemis National Park which is incidentally the largest ecological reserve in India. Set in a sprawling 1290 square miles this Park leaves a beautiful impression on the mind.</p>
<p>Rare forms of wildlife like Snow Leopard, Tibetan Ibex, Argali and Ladakhi Urial are found here. The birds to watch out for are Lammergeier vulture, Robin Accentor, Fork Swift; Crimson billed Cock, Golden Eagle, and Tibetan Snowfinch and Himalayan Griffon vulture. There are beautiful Tibetan handicraft selling shops inside Hems national Park.
