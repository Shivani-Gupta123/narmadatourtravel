										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Please be a traveller, not a tourist. Try new things, meet new people, and look beyond what’s right in front of you. Those are the keys to understanding this amazing world we live in.” &#8211; Andrew Zimmern.</p>
<p>So true this is and yet only few manage to look beyond normal travel routines and discover places, people and food; taste real adventure. In today’s fast-paced world, people have less time to travel and even lesser time to actually explore new places which can enhance their experiences. And going beyond the usual sometimes makes all the difference between a traveller and a tourist. Tourists travelling to Leh Ladakh by air arrive at Leh which offers the first glimpse of Ladakh. The usual itinerary comprises popular sites like Khardung La, Nubra Valley and Pangong Tso, but there are host of other places which can offer uniqueness and sense of discovery to the traveller. So here is a list of such places for all you adventurous people and will bring out the traveller in you.</p>
<p><strong>01. Turtuk (210 Kms from Leh)</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Turtuk-Village-Leh.jpg" alt="Turtuk Village Leh" width="700" height="417" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3948" /><br />
Tucked in a corner towards Line of Control is this beautiful, peaceful and colourful village named Turtuk. It is the last point in Shyok Valley and 85 KM from Hundar. Shyok River follows you throughout your journey and offers some great and magnificent locations which will stay in your memory forever. The valley concisely tapers near tiny Changmar village after which the real changes start. Till 1971, Turtuk was part of Baltisan (now in Pakistan) which became part of India after the war. Culturally you will find Buddhists and Muslim-Balti but the inhabitants are originally of Buddhism religion which is the pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet. In the 8th century they were converted to Tibetan Buddhism and subsequently in Islam in the 13th century. There are 2 areas the Upper and the lower Turtuk both different scenically.</p>
<p><strong>02. Dah Hanu (The Land of Aryans) (165 Kms from Leh)</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Dha-Hanu-Village.jpg" alt="Dha Hanu Village" width="700" height="395" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3946" /><br />
The villages of Dah and Hanu are situated to the northwest of the town of Leh towards Lamayuru. One of the major attractions of Dah &amp; Hanu is to meet people of Brogpa or Dard community. They are ethnically distinct from the rest of Ladakhis and they believe that they are a pure Aryan race which migrated from Europe about 1000 years ago. The language spoken within the community is Brogskad which is quite different from Ladakhi. Brogpa means mountain dwellers and their culture can be seen in a local festival Bona Na. Their ancient traditions and way of life are partly preserved through their songs, festivals and hymns. The location itself is extremely beautiful with the colorful flowers all over the village gardens overlooking the turquoise river Indus and golden Barley fields. It is a view that remains etched forever…</p>
<p><strong>03. Chilling (60 Kms from Leh)</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chilling-Leh.jpg" alt="Chilling Leh" width="700" height="447" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3944" /><br />
This is a quaint and hidden village where some of the famous treks in Markha and Zanskar valley either start or end. And I must tell you this is one of best small rides I have had in and around Leh. You can really feel the remoteness and experience some mind blowing views of the valley. It is extremely beautiful with Zanskar River flowing by your side, small and even smaller settlements, colour changing mountains and warm people. I can bet you would think and rethink before going back to your mundane lives. It definitely makes to our top 5 lists very comfortably.</p>
<p><strong>04. Hanle (255 Kms from Leh)</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Hanle-Leh.jpg" alt="Hanle Leh" width="700" height="437" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3947" /><br />
This is a village in Changthang region and is notably the southernmost part of Ladakh. It is serene, calm, enchanting and is best for people who want to feel nothingness, vastness and awe amongst the majestic and pristine Himalayas. It is also home to Hanle or Analy Gompa of 17th century which belongs to a branch of Tibetan Buddhism. Hanle is known for its Indian Astronomical Observatory and it is now being equipped with Major Atmosphere Cherenkov Experiment (MACE) gamma-ray telescope being built here will be the world’s largest telescope at the highest altitude and the second largest gamma-ray telescope in the world. So all those astronomical guys out there, this is the place to be next season</p>
<p><strong>05. Chushul (210 Kms from Leh)</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chushul-Leh.jpg" alt="Chushul Leh" width="700" height="437" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3945" /><br />
It is another village in the Changthang region which is close to Pangong Lake. Home to beautiful salt marshes where you get to see Black Necked Cranes, an endangered species which migrate here every year. This is the place where fierce army battle has taken place in 1962 with Chinese army and our heroes once again proved their mettle. Nearby there are awesome views to follow including Mirpal Tso, another beautiful lake. You can also see the Spangur Gap which is a mountain pass on the Line of Actual Control from where a lake and Chinese territory is also visible. Bring on the respect for army by visiting the War Memorial and pay your salute as well. We have marked these locations for you in a map.</p>
<p>Even though we have just covered 5, Ladakh has many tiny, quaint and pristine locations and have a lot to offer for both travellers and tourists. The green oasis in such raw and unforgiving cold desert brings a different hue to our mind and thoughts. The only fact that still surprises me is how people have survived and have learnt to live with very little and still remain content and happy. The Land of High Passes is barren yet amazingly beautiful, poor yet culturally rich, distant yet feels friendly, similar yet contrastingly diverse, harsh yet soulful calming.</p>
<p>They say “the travel never ends but the road does”. So explore more, keep riding, be safe and do visit the one and only Leh Ladakh.		</p>

A mud side path from the highway leads to a side valley and after crossing a ford, you enter the complex of Basgo Gompa known to the Tibetans as the ‘Divine Peak of Great Stability’. This complex comprises of the Basgo citadel or fortress and three temples. These were built by the Tibetan king Gragspabum and his descendants in the 16th and 17th centuries, though some historians argue that the fortress existed much earlier.</p>
<p>What is left amidst the ruins of the fortress is a long lower wall with the remains of shelters for animals and broken yet majestic towers. A lack of written history has been instrumental in lending a lot of mystery to this elusive mud-brick fortress.</p>
<p>The three mud-brick temples located inside the rammed earth walls of the fortress are dedicated to Maitreya Buddha &#8211; the fifth incarnation of Sakyamuni, who is also popularly known as ‘Future Buddha.’ These buildings seem very austere from the outside, but rich and colorful murals adorn the interior walls showcasing vignettes from the life of Buddha; some showing Padmasambhava, Sakyamuni and other Buddhist deities in meditative moods.</p>
<p>The largest of these temples is Chamba Lhakhang built atop the hill and can only be accessed through a set of steep stairs. You get the most excellent views of Basgo village and the entire ruin complex from here. It holds a 14 meter high, gilded statue of the Maitreya Buddha. Some people believe that the ancient fortress were not built by the Tibetan king, but by Jamyang Namgyal and it was his son, Singge who built this two-storey high golden copper-gilded statue in the memory of his father. This temple also is home to some of the most extraordinary celestial paintings of the heavens and heavenly bodies.</p>
<p>The second temple, Serzing Lhakhang is lower down the hill and is older than the first one. It is very dark inside, and along with another statue of Buddha, there are cabinets containing holy books and some of the scripts here in this room are written in gold, copper and silver letters.</p>
<p>The third and smallest temple, Chan Chung is at the bottom of the hill and is the ideal place for taking pictures of the adjacent fields and villages. The chief colours in this temple are dark blues and reds making it very dark inside; it also contains a huge statue of Buddha flanked by murals of protector gods on the walls.</p>
<p>Inspite of being such a rich and beautiful historical site, Basgo Gompa receives very few visitors which is a shame because tourists running after the popular well-known places to see in Ladakh are missing out on a unique and one-of-its-kind experience of this Basgo Gompa legendary murals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thousands of Tourists visiting Kashmir are also making their way to Kargil these days. Tourists brushing aside their fear of gunshots and bloodshed at the border have actually started responding to the beauties of nature that surround the land of Kargil. If you have plans to go on a Kargil tour, the Kargil tourism guide below might be of great help. So read on.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-970" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Kargil.jpg" alt="Kargil Tourism" width="700" height="430" /><br />
Kashmir is popular among tourists for its scenic locations and Kargil is no different. It is located in the region of Ladakh and is the 2nd largest town over there. Kargil lies on the boundary in the border that joins Pakistan. The location of Kargil is in sync with its name as it is sandwiched at the intersection point of two countries. There are many locales in Kargil that could tempt the tourists. Most of the best tourist spots in Kargil are at Mulbek which is located at a distance of about 45 km from the Wakha river banks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The main attraction of this place is the Buddhist monuments that are plenty in number.</li>
<li>An ancient sculpture of Buddha Maitreya composed of stone can be seen on the highway Mulbek Chamba. It has a height of 9 meters.</li>
<li>The Wakha River Valley consists of a number of cave monasteries as well as Buddhist nunneries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kargil is a place to halt for tourists travelling to the Kashmir Valley as it is the Eastern Gateway of the Valley. Not only are the locations here scenic but also big fun for people on the lookout for adventure trips. Loads of adventure activities are available here such as trekking and mountaineering. The spirituality of Kargil is another aspect that is welcoming for tourists. There are lots of places belonging to both historical as well religious categories that are blissful. The literal meaning of the word ‘Kargil’ implies ‘A place between kingdoms’.</p>
<p><strong>Accommodation</strong><br />
Kargil has several hotels of various ranges depending on the comfort levels that you wish for and the budget that you have in your mind. There are deluxe hotels of different star-rating as well as small hotels available. Some of the popular hotels available there are Hotel Siachen, Caravan Sarai Hotel and D’zojila hotel are the deluxe hotels. All the hotels available here are of high comfort levels be it of any budget or star rating. You can have a comfortable stay with the choices of local and foreign cuisines at these hotels.</p>
<p><strong>How to Reach</strong><br />
The routes from Srinagar to Leh are open from May to October every year. It is a distance of about 440 kms.  You can get there through buses, taxis or even motorbikes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buses:</strong> You can opt for Government buses as well as private bus operators to reach Leh. It takes about 2 days to complete the journey with the night stop at Kargil.</li>
<li><strong>Taxis:</strong> You can book taxis that too in different ways – solo taxi or shared depending on your comfort levels and budget.</li>
<li><strong>Motorbikes:</strong> If you are into biking, then you can opt for renting motorbikes preferably from  Gaya Bihar.</li>
</ul>
<p>The route from Srinagar to Sonamarg is filled with majestic vistas that Kashmir is famous for. The ride is pretty much safe considering the presence of a heavy batter of army soldiers at frequent points. Sonamarg is a beautiful place and a stoppage in between allows you to enjoy the scenery of the place for a short while before resumption. From there you shall have to take the route to Drass and the this road isn’t in great condition due to the rains which makes it slushy. On the way through to the summit of the pass, tourists will have to undergo the registration process to travel further to Drass. From Drass, you shall have to go through a straight route that takes you to Kargil within an hour. On the way to Kargil, you shall witness the memorials built as a tribute to the brave soldiers of the 1999 Kargil War. You can easily find accommodation on arrival at Kargil as it is a main pit stop for travelers going to Leh.</p>
<p><strong>Events and Festivals</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-973" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Losar-festival-Kargil.jpg" alt="Losar festival, Kargil" width="700" height="429" /><br />

<p><strong>Tourist Spots</strong><br />
Some of the recommended tourist spots in Kargil are:-</p>

<li><strong>Mulbek:</strong> Another nice spot to visit which is located on the Kargil-Leh road about 42 km away from Kargil.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mystic land of Ladakh has lots to offer to a tourist. Explore its craggy topography kissing the sky, the green sprawling vales, the pellucid lakes of crystal-clear blue water and you’ll indeed feel you have arrived at a land detached from the chaos of the surrounding world. Read on to learn about Ladakh’s top 10 tourist destinations.</p>
<p>Ladakh is a mystical and mysterious land and is meant for the discerning tourist who is jaded of the overcrowded usual tourist routes and wants to sample the exquisite untouched beauty of the land of Monasteries; Ladakh. To explore Ladakh well you need a minimum of 15 days as there are innumerable places of interest which are pretty inaccessible and require a lot of time to travel. However if you are short on time but still would like to see the principal attractions of Ladakh then the Top 10 Tourist Destinations in Ladakh are shortlisted for you.</p>
<h3><strong>Tourist Attractions in Leh-Ladakh</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Leh: The Capital town of Ladakh</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-754" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Leh-Town-e1411823078568.jpg" alt="Leh Town" width="700" height="300" /><br />
You will anyway be visiting the town of Leh as the only airport in Ladakh lies here. This is an ancient mystical town full of opportunities for sightseeing and shopping. Visit the Namgyal Peak which was the victory peak for the Namgyal Monarchs who ruled over Leh for centuries. The Stok Palace and the Leh Palace are the places in which the Ladakh Monarchs used to stay. The Tsemo Gompa with its intricate paintings and huge Thangka is also an unmissable attraction of the town and so is the smaller Avalokiteshvara Monastery just below it.</p>
<p>The Leh Bazaar is ideal for a shopping expedition (you won’t find much of shopping opportunities in rest of Ladakh). The top buys here are silver artifacts, chunky Tibetan jewelry, Pashmina shawls, Prayer Wheels and Thangkas. Book a vehicle (preferably a Jeep) if you want to see the rest of the Ladakh well because Leh is where all tourists make conveyance arrangements too.</p>
<p><strong>Pangong Tso Lake in Ladakh</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4556" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pangong-Tso-Lake.jpg" alt="Pangong Tso Lake" width="700" height="422" /><br />
The Pangong Tso Lake is unlike anything that you have seen in the rest of your life. For starters it’s an exhilarating but difficult journey as you have to cross the Chang La which is supposed to be the third highest motor able road in the world and you will have to climb to an altitude of 17,500 feet to reach there. The view is astounding and you will scarcely be able to put the camera away. Pangong is actually an army outpost besides which lies the huge Pangong Tso lake; the most beautiful Lake in Ladakh. If you are in Ladakh during winters then it’s possible to have a “walking on water experience as the Lake solidifies to ice. During summers you will be able to see robins, pelicans and red breasted cuckoos flying over the lake. There are an amazing range of flowers which grow right beside the lake making it an amazing experience.</p>
<p><strong>Zanskar Valley in Ladakh</strong></p>
<p>Zanskar Valley is about 5 hours from Leh and its better to ride up there by car as there are lots of places of interest here. This is called the Virgin Valley because of the unspool innocence of the landscape. If you are interested in adventure sports then you will enjoy the white water rafting trip from Zanskar to Phey village.</p>
<p>The Bardan Gompa and the Karsha Monasteries are the two famous monasteries of Zanskar Valley. 100 different Buddha incarnations are depicted in the Karsha Monastery which is situated right beside the beautiful Doda River. Padum village with its crooked little houses with rose and apricot gardens and the lovely Khar palace is also a must see attraction here.</p>
<p><strong>Nubra Valley: Paradise in Ladakh</strong><br />
Caravans of merchants used to carry spices, silk and condiments along the famous Silk Route of which Nubra Valley was a major stop. For an authentic experience ditch your car for half an hour and hitch a ride atop the 2 humped Bactrian Camels that are found on hire there.</p>
<p>If you feel uncomfortable maneuvering the unnaturally high altitude and extreme temperature of Ladakh then Nubra Valley will provide you with a breath of fresh air. For starters the altitude is lower here and you will have a break from the rarified atmosphere in the rest of Ladakh. This is the most beautiful area in Ladakh and takes 5 hours by Jeep from Leh.</p>
<p>The Diskit Monastery is the biggest Monastery in this area with gleaming Chortens, Mani walls, Thangkas and carved Tibetan inscriptions. Diskit Village has lots of shops (in case shopping fever has hit you) and plenty of good restaurants serving world cuisine.</p>
<p><strong>Brokpa Villages of Ladakh</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-758" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Brokpa-Villages.jpg" alt="Brokpa Villages" width="640" height="429" /><br />
If anthropology and culture fascinates you then the Dha and Baigdandu Villages which are a part of the cluster of Brokpa Villages will fascinate you. Centuries ago when Alexander the Great along with his magnificent army had conquered the rest of the world before being demoralized and turning back at the frontiers of Ladakh; some soldiers of his army stayed back. The soldiers were enchanted with the loveliness of the land and being too tired to travel all the way back, they married local beauties and opened inns, pubs, bookshops and hotels here. There is complete prevalence of European culture here with dating, open relationships and independent existence being the norm. Sample the local pancakes and honey, look at the apricot and cherry orchards and see the villagers dressed up in the red feather and bead costumes dance; it’s an experience of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Incidentally, these villages are nearer to Srinagar Airport (5 hours) than the Leh Airport (8.5 hours).</p>
<p><strong>Sumur Nubra Sand Dune Park in Ladakh</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-762" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nubra-Sand-Dune-Park.jpg" alt="Nubra Sand Dune Park" width="640" height="425" /><br />
Sumoor Nubra is India’s only cold desert park. It’s about -6 hours from Leh Airport and is reachable by Jeep or Volvo Bus both of which you can avail from Leh. Once you reach the Sand Dune leisure Park, make sure you attempt the Bactrian two humped camel ride across the park premises. This camel is peculiar only to this region and you will feel like a nomad experiencing the charms of the desert. Mountain climbing is done on the rocky mountain and there are opportunities of biking too. Overnight camp stay in full A.C tent with excellent food, wine, music and cultural programs is arranged by the Sumoor Nubra management.</p>
<p><strong>Uleytokpo: Monastery Village in Ladakh</strong><br />
Uleytokpo besides being one of the prettiest villages in Ladakh is home to 3 of Ladakh’s famous Monasteries; Alchi, Lamayuru and Rizdong. The luxury Uley Resort is situated over here which offers the last word in exotic comfort amidst picturesque surroundings.</p>
<p>Alchi Monastery has 4 main areas of interest; Rinchen Zangpo monument, Chortens, Dukhang (prayer hall) and Manjushri Temple. Don’t forget to visit the Mangyu, Shakyamuni and Vairocana temple complex nearby. Lamayuru Monastery which is one off oldest monasteries in Ladakh shouldn’t be missed.</p>
<p><strong>Confluence of Zanskar and Indus Rivers</strong><br />
The confluence of the Zanskar and Indus River is one of the most beautiful places in Ladakh. The waters of the Indus and Zanskar are distinguishable by the different strains of blue coloring. Many adventure tours and travel organizers set up camps at this point. If you visit this place between July to September you can participate in the river rafting activities which are a thrilling experience in themselves. Fishing, Bird watching and photography are the other major activities here. Ladakh is home to more than 50 varieties of birds many of which are now endangered like Golden Eagle.</p>
<p><strong>Magnetic Hills in Ladakh</strong><br />
People from all across the world come to see the famous Magnetic Hill in Ladakh which defies gravity. Just leave the park in neutral gear and watch it climb uphill at a speed of 10 km per hour on its own. This place is the only area in the world where vehicles climb up a hill even when engine is turned off. This is because the Hill has special magnetic properties. The Magnetic Hill is 30 km away from the capital town of Leh and is one of the most curious places in Ladakh.</p>
<p><strong>Hemis National Park in Ladakh</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-761" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Hemis-National-Park-in-Ladakh1.jpg" alt="Hemis National Park in Ladakh" width="600" height="450" /><br />
The strangest thing about Ladakh is that there are no parks except the Hemis National Park which is incidentally the largest ecological reserve in India. Set in a sprawling 1290 square miles this Park leaves a beautiful impression on the mind.</p>
<p>Rare forms of wildlife like Snow Leopard, Tibetan Ibex, Argali and Ladakhi Urial are found here. The birds to watch out for are Lammergeier vulture, Robin Accentor, Fork Swift; Crimson billed Cock, Golden Eagle, and Tibetan Snowfinch and Himalayan Griffon vulture. There are beautiful Tibetan handicraft selling shops inside Hems national Park. Another must see attraction here is the large and superbly beautiful Hemis Monastery with its ancient Thangkas and tall Buddha statues.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hemis monastery, known as one of the most ancient monastery in Ladakh. Hemis monastery representative reincarnate of Buddha. Hemis Gompa is one of the most important in Ladakh quite apart from its annual festival. You can gain an impression of the extent of the monastery area by climbing the so called eyrie, a hermitage (Gotsang Gompa) reached by one hour, three km climb to 3900 meters. The 13th century monastery pre-dates the Hemis Gompa and was built by Syalwa Gotsangpa. There are about a dozen monks living there.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-8504 alignright" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Hemis-Monastery.jpg" alt="Hemis Monastery" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>The thousand square meter courtyard of the Hemis Gompa is entered from the north-east. The two prayer flags, in front of the first steps up to the Dukhang, form which there is a good view of the dancers during the festival. A few places are reserved for guest but it is sometimes possible to buy ‘admission tickets’ to the gallery from business-minded monks! The day before the two-day festival the part which foreigners can watch begins at 10 am with ceremonies in the courtyard. After prayers in the Dukhang the Rimpoche climbs the steps up to the courtyard, accompanied by musician monks, crosses it and takes his place underneath the gallery.</p>
<h3><strong>Dance and Festivals</strong></h3>
<p>The Gompa is famous far beyond the borders of Ladakh for its he is festival (Hemis Setchu or Mela of the Hemis Gompa). This takes place every year with mask dances on the 10th and 11th day of the fifth Tibetan month. This date usually falls in the second half of June although it sometimes goes into the beginning of July. Hemis also has a gigantic Tanka, one of the largest in the world, which is only displayed to the public every 11 years at the Hemis Festival. It was unveiled at the 1980 festival so it will not be shown again until 1991. The festival draws pilgrims from all over Ladakh and, since 1975, tourist from all over the world. Apart from being one of the largest in Ladakh it is virtually the only major religious festival in Ladakh which is held in the summer, when the passes are open. A monastery in Zanskar has a similar festival, with mask dances, in the summer months. Recently there have been deliberations by the monks of Karsha Gompa, the Zanskar monastery near Padum, whether mask dances usually held in the winter months should be switched to the summer. This would be a further attraction for a visit to Zanskar.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards the dances begin, which have as their theme the struggle against evil and infidels and the investable victory of good and of Buddhism. The Padmasambhavas Dance, which shows the conquest of the Ruta demons, is part of this dance. Other figures which the dancers represent are Yama – the God of Death, the black-hatted sorcerer Guru Trakpo – the vanquisher of all demons, and various other forms of Padmasambhavas. The sequence of the dances changes with time – often to present a different finale from for the benefit of distinguished guests! The dancing continues to late afternoon, with a brief stop at mid-day. Locals and foreigners wall where tea, soup, Tsampa, sweets and other refreshments are sold. If you wish to take photographs take account of the position of the sun when selecting your vantage point. In the crowded conditions during the dancing it is virtually impossible to leave your place.</p>
<p>If you visit the Gompa outside the festival time you will be impressed by the stillness of the valley. You will also have the opportunity to see the various chapels. Near the Dukhang is the Lakhang, which is the first one after a small set of steps from the yard. The doors are placed inwards so that the front room stands behind, its roof supported with four poles. The side walls of this front room are covered with partially damaged frescoes of the watchers of the heavenly directions. In the Dukhang, the general assembly room, the throne of the Rimpoche dominates the sitting places of the monks. In the Lakhang there is a large gilded statue of the Buddha Shakyamuni with blue hair, surrounded by several silver Chortens which, as in Spituk Gompa, are decorated with semi-precious stones. There are also beautiful frescoes on the Lakhang Nyingpo which is otherwise practically empty. The hands of the artists who prepared the gimp’s giant Tanka are revered as holy relics but Hemis also has many lesser, but still interesting, Tankas. Hemis also has an excellent library, particularly well preserved wall paintings and good Buddha figures.</p>
<p>In the second and third storeys, near the other chapels like the Zankhang, there is the Kharrabgysal, the rooms of the Rimpoche or head lama. The Rimpoche, spiritual overland of Hemis, is a reincarnation of the monastery’s founder, Stagshang Raspa, who built Hemis in the first half of the 17th century, under King Sengge Namgyal who also established the monasteries of Chemre, Hansel and Tingmosgang. The last overload of the Gompa was a reincarnation that, as a five-year old child, was undergoing training in Tibet when the Chinese invaded. Since then the Chakzot (manager) a brother of the late king of Ladakh, has conducted the business of the Gompa. Because of the Chinese takeover of Tibet the monastery has had no communication with its Rimpoche since the ‘60s. During the 1975 festival Dugpa Rimpoche, 1 12 year-old youth, became the new Rimpoche as a new incarnation.</p>
<p>He is at the same time the overload of the Drugpa Kagyu, one of the six divisions of the red-cap sect who, before the Chinese invasion of Tibet, possessed influence practically only in Bhutan and Ladakh. In Ladakh the Stagna and Chemre monasteries belong to this order, while Spitok belongs to the yellow-cap (Gelugpa order). Drukpa Rinpoche currently lives in Darjeeling, where he is completing his training.</p>
<h4><strong>How to Reach</strong></h4>
<p>Hemis is easily reached by a car or jeep from Leh (5 km) but rather difficult to get to by public transport. By car you follow the Upshi road past Shey and Tikse, this is the Manli road which follows the Indus. Past the TCP checkpoint at Karu you turn to the right to cross the Indus over a new bridge and follow the winding road up towards the Gompa. Unlike many other Gompas Hemis is not visible from afar – it only comes into view when you’re right beside it.</p>
<p>There is only one regular bus a day from Leh towards Hemis and it does not go right to the Gompa. You take the Sakti bus which departs Leh around 11 am and get down at Karu Bridge. You then have to walk up the six km road, it takes about two hours. Since the bus continues on to Sakti, turns around there and starts off on the return trip to Leh at 2 or 2.30 pm there is no way you can get up to the Gompa and back down to catch the bus back on the same day. Thus if you want to visit Hemis by bus you must plan on staying overnight at the monastery and returning the next day. During the tourist season the tourist office erects tents at Hemis for overnight visitors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been called ‘the moonland’, or ‘the last Shangri La’. Those romantic definitions all hold more than a slight degree of truth. Ladakh is the most remote region of India, a barren, virtually rainless area which lies north of the Himalayan, an area known geographically as the Tibetan plateau. The Himalayas serve as a barrier to clouds carrying rain form the Sahara. The result is the ‘moonland’ label – much of Ladakh looks much like the moon, a barren, grey-brown landscape from faraway glaciers or melting snow, carry water to habitation do you find plant life. Ladakh is a part of strategically important Jammu and Kashmir; there are so many places to visit for so many reasons.</p>
<p>Here are some visiting places in Ladakh listed below:</p>
<p><strong>Drass</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-607" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Drass.jpg" alt="Drass, Ladakh" width="700" height="600" /><br />
This is a small village with a TCP and a large military camp on the Drass River, en route to Kargil. The public works Department Rest House has a tourist officer and stands on the right hand side of the road from Srinagar. It can’t be missed as it is directly opposite the Rahi Tea Stall where there is ‘Hot Tea Available Anytime’. Drass is famed for its freezing temperatures and heavy winter snowfalls. In this area the dialect spoken is named after the weather &#8211; Hambabs means snowfall. For trekking from Drass to Sanku (Suru Valley).</p>
<p>From Drass to Kargil the road follows the river. At a left-hand curve outside of Drass four 7th century Buddhist bas-reliefs stand next to the road: Maitreya, Avalokitesvera, an equestrian figure and a lotus. Beyond Tashgam the valley narrows and the mountain side on both sides of the river are covered with rocks and pebbles. Shortly before the road from the Drass Valley turns off into the Suru Valley a reasonable bridge, passable by jeeps, crosses the Drass River towards the left. This bridge is barred to foreigners as it leads into a restricted military area.</p>
<p>From Drass the road runs to Kharbu (10 km), to Channigund (14 km) an then Kargil (10 km). The villages along the route are all hundreds of meters above the road, on small plateau. Beyond Tashgam the Landscape becomes more rocky, the mountains on both sides of the ricer reaching 5000 to 5500 meters.</p>
<p><strong>Kargil</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-608" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Kargil-e1407578859928.jpg" alt="Kargil Town" width="700" height="301" /><br />
Kargil was once an important trading post due to its strategic location at strategic location at the intersection of trade routes from Russia to India and from China to the west. Over the last 30 years political changes have considerably reduced its importance. Today it is just a village at the junction of the Drass and Suru Rivers, 20 km from the Indus; a stopping point with hotels, camping facilities and a service station on the road to Leh. The buses to and from Leh stop for the night here. Civilian leave for Leh between 4.30 and 5 am.</p>
<p>If you are contemplating trekking in Zanskar or Ladakh it is worth pointing out that until Padum travelers must live off their stored supplies for virtually the entire distance. Anything forgotten in Srinagar should, therefore, be bought here. Due to the strong religious beliefs of the local population great difficulties accompany the purchase of alcohol.</p>
<p>The dialect spoken here is Purik and shows its relationship with the dialect spoken in Skardu, Pakistan. In contrast to the rest of Ladakh, the children here are taught in Arabic. A momentous occasion in Kargil is the archery contest in May. By the time of gets to Kargil the traveler will have been struck by the artificially irrigated fields. Since irrigation is so important in this region, the distribution of water requires great care. Every village is divided into groups, called Gowar, of from five to 10 families, to ensure an equitable arrangement. In Kargil itself the conspicuous absence of women in the streets is a consequence of Islamic religious practice. The people follow the Shi’ite Moslem sect, like the Iranians.</p>
<p>Kargil is the second largest town in Ladakh and has a population of about 3000. It’s situated in a lovely valley with apricot trees growing in the intensively cultivated fileds. Willows and poplars grow beside the irrigation ditches which lead to the terraced files. They furnish building materials for the construction of houses in this nearly treeless land.</p>
<p>Trespone and sankhoo are two ‘Imambaras” found in Kargil. These Turkish style buildings have Persian and Arabic speaking Moslem mystic’s kwon as Aghas in residence. Kargil also has a mosque, the Jami Masjid. Kargil’s Moslems are noted for their extreme orthodoxy.</p>
<p><strong>Around Kargil</strong><br />
Mount Kala Pahar (4575 metres) near to Kargil was under Pakistani control until the 1971 India-Pakistan conflict. In that war the borders of India were pushed further to the west but one still cannot travel directly to the Indus Valley and along the Indus to Leh. One must still take the hard way over the Namika-La and Fatu-La passes and reach the Indus Valley by Khalsi. At present a road is being built around the Namika-La pass – ‘which touches the sky’. It runs through the forbidden zone, west of the present road. In this region are the interesting villages of Garkon, Dards, Dardchik and Dha Hanu, whose population (altogether about 700 people) is light skinned and speaks a language which sounds like Russian although it also contains elements of Persian and Sanskrit, the language of the Aryan invaders. The remote locality and the custom of marrying only amongst themselves have preserved their distinctive indent right up to the present day. The government of the village is the responsibility of a seven-man village council, chosen by all men in the village. In July these villages celebrate a harvest festival which lasts for several days. Garkon is 80 km from Kargil.</p>
<p><strong>Shergol</strong><br />
The small village of Shergol is 33 km from Kargil. The village, on the right hand side of the Wakkha River, is hard to see from the road as it lies behind a mountain. A small Gompa perches half-way up the eastern slope of this mountain. Appropriate to its size the Gompa has only two monks who are tended b a single nun. Some of the room, such as the kitchen, are hewn from the rock and resemble holes more than rooms. At the foot of the mountain, near the 35-houses village (210 inhabitants), there is a less important Gompa.</p>
<p><strong>Mulbekh</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6286" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mulbekh-monastery-1024x683.jpg" alt="mulbekh-monastery" width="840" height="560" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mulbekh-monastery-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mulbekh-monastery-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mulbekh-monastery-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mulbekh-monastery-165x110.jpg 165w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mulbekh-monastery-370x247.jpg 370w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mulbekh-monastery-780x520.jpg 780w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/mulbekh-monastery.jpg 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /><br />
A further seven from Shergol brings you to this Wakhan valley village. The palace of Rajah Chalon of Mulbekh is on the left hand side of the road. Above the village on the slopes is a double monastery. It’s a difficult ascent, particularly if you are not yet acclimatized to the altitude of Ladakh. Two paths lead to the Gompa and the right hand path (Monastery Mountain to the left) is the easier. Here, as with all Gompas  in Ladakh, one should make enquiries’ beforehand in the village as to whether the monks are present. Often the Gompas may be deserted for days at a time and therefore shut. Only in the mornings and evening can one be sure of encountering lamas who are not engaged in prayer. We were able to put two lamas of Mulbekh Gompa into action by showing them pictures of the Dalai Lama. These pictures of a holy and are haled accordingly – carefully touched, pressed on the forehead and reverentially returned. With amazing speed the lamas then ascended the mountain and opened the Gompas (the Serdung and Gandentse Gompas) for us.</p>
<p>Choose the direct path up to the Gompas even though it seems steep for it gives a better view of the Wakkha Valley. A festive highpoint is the harvest thanksgiving festival (Shuba) which is celebrated at the same time in practically all larger Wakkha Valley villages. Mulbekh Subhla is a great attraction during the harvest time when the oracle of Mulbekh makes an appearance. In one is incarnated in a young farmer.</p>
<p>One should always remove one’s shoes when visiting a Gompa. If you do not like going barefoot, the floors are often coated with rancid butterfat, take along socks or stockings for these visits. Obviously one should also have a reverent attitude;’ don’t make loud noises or touch holy figures. Remember that Mani walls or Chortens should always be walked around clockwise with the structure on your right.</p>
<p><strong>Chamba Statue</strong><br />
A km beyond Mulbekh, beside the road on the right hand side, is a huge figure of the Matriya, or future, Buddha, cut into the rock. The figure is thought to date from Kushan period, around the time of the birth of Christ. Inscriptions found on the side of the rock are in the Kharosthi script. A new small temple, which partly obscures the figure, was built in 1975.</p>
<p><strong>Gel</strong><br />
If you wish to make more than a short pause at Mulbekh and to experience a little of the local way of life then visit the village of Gel. The small village, picturesquely situated on a steep slope above the Wakkha River, still lives, (like many Ladakh villages) in a bygone era. Although it is only a few km from the surfaced road Indian soldiers rarely come here and during a visit there time seems to stand still. When we visited Get not only did the children cry when they first saw us, but adults held the animals fast in their quarters, barricaded the doors and observed us suspiciously form the roofs of their houses. The ice was rapidly broken, however, when we wanted to buy an expensive Giri (hand-spindle with distaff). With the construction of the new jeep-road to the Namika-La, the modern world is now encroaching upon Ge.</p>
<p><strong>Namika La &amp; Fatu La</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-610" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Namika-La.jpg" alt="Namika La" width="700" height="534" /><br />
From Mulbekh the road climbs through a sand hill landscape to the 3718 meter high Namika La. The first village beyond the pass is Kangral; a small collection of houses where it may be possible to obtain fuel Here also a dirt road branches to the left, leading to Stakchey, Samra, Chiktan (with old palace ruins), Sihakar, and Sanjar and along the Indus to eventually meet the Kargil-Khalsi road. The principal town in the valley of the Kanji Nallah is Bodh Kharbu, a large military camp which stretches put on both the right and left sides of the road. In the rest houses of the PWD, on the left had side of the road, the two traveler’s rooms can sometimes be used by tourists. There are many government projects underway during the beautiful summer moths so your chances of finding a room free are not good.</p>
<p>The road follows the river for a short time and then winds its way to the 4094 meter high Fatu La pass, which is always cool and windy. This is the highest pass on the Srinagar-Leh road. About 15 km from the top of the pass the old Tibetan monastery of Lamayuru stands below the road on a crumbling mountain. There is a village on the mountain side.</p>
<p><strong>Basgo</strong><br />
Above the road at this small town is the heavily devastated Basgo Fort. Basgo Gompa is worth a visit on account of its Buddha figures but, unfortunately, its wall painting have been badly water damaged. The first Gompa has a two-storey high golden Chamba statue in ‘European’ sitting posture. Smaller Chamba statues stand in front of the figure of the white clothed Chamonada. One of the three monks who live below the Gompa in a small house will have the Gompa key.</p>
<p><strong>Nimmu</strong><br />
On the right had side of the road in the green fields there are four ‘Gate’ Chortens. Just 2.5 km beyond Nimmu the road leads to the place where the Zanskar River flows into the Indus through the Nimmu Gateway (Nimmu Gyasgo), a large cleft rock. From here it is only 35 km to Leh.</p>
