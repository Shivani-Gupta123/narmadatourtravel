Kashmir is popular among tourists for its scenic locations and Kargil is no different. It is located in the region of Ladakh and is the 2nd largest town over there. Kargil lies on the boundary in the border that joins Pakistan. The location of Kargil is in sync with its name as it is sandwiched at the intersection point of two countries. There are many locales in Kargil that could tempt the tourists. Most of the best tourist spots in Kargil are at Mulbek which is located at a distance of about 45 km from the Wakha river banks.</p>
<ul>

<li>An ancient sculpture of Buddha Maitreya composed of stone can be seen on the highway Mulbek Chamba. It has a height of 9 meters.</li>

</ul>

Not only are the locations here scenic but also big fun for people on the lookout for adventure trips. Loads of adventure activities are available here such as trekking and mountaineering. The spirituality of Kargil is another aspect that is welcoming for tourists. There are lots of places belonging to both historical as well religious categories that are blissful. The literal meaning of the word ‘Kargil’ implies ‘A place between kingdoms’.</p>
<p><strong>Accommodation</strong><br />

The routes from Srinagar to Leh are open from May to October every year. It is a distance of about 440 kms.  You can get there through buses, taxis or even motorbikes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buses:</strong> You can opt for Government buses as well as private bus operators to reach Leh. It takes about 2 days to complete the journey with the night stop at Kargil.</li>
<li><strong>Taxis:</strong> You can book taxis that too in different ways – solo taxi or shared depending on your comfort levels and budget.</li>
<li><strong>Motorbikes:</strong> If you are into biking, then you can opt for renting motorbikes preferably from  Gaya Bihar.</li>
</ul>
<p>The route from Srinagar to Sonamarg is filled with majestic vistas that Kashmir is famous for. The ride is pretty much safe considering the presence of a heavy batter of army soldiers at frequent points. Sonamarg is a beautiful place and a stoppage in between allows you to enjoy the scenery of the place for a short while before resumption. From there you shall have to take the route to Drass and the this road isn’t in great condition due to the rains which makes it slushy. On the way through to the summit of the pass, tourists will have to undergo the registration process to travel further to Drass. From Drass, you shall have to go through a straight route that takes you to Kargil within an hour. On the way to Kargil, you shall witness the memorials built as a tribute to the brave soldiers of the 1999 Kargil War. You can easily find accommodation on arrival at Kargil as it is a main pit stop for travelers going to Leh.</p>
