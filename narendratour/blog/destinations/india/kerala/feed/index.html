										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>God’s own country- that’s what <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/kerala">Kerala</a> has always been. Naturally, a land so pretty that it beckons even the heavens into its premises deserves a capital city that is no less charming and exquisite. And Trivandrum is the place that remains steeped in pride in being the capital of this really magnificent of all states in India. Thiruvananthapuram or Trivandrum is as exotic a <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/kerala-tourist-attractions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tourist destination as Kerala</a> itself, earning it the epithet of the Evergreen City of India.</p>
<p>Indeed, residing in the plethora of natural wonders as it does, Trivandrum is no lesser a haven than the state it ‘capitalises on’. But even as a prime tourist destination, Trivandrum still harbours places that remain rare, in that they are less known names and lesser explored destinations. Here’s a list of rare places to visit in Trivandrum so that you dare to venture on the road less taken on your next Kerala travel sojourn-</p>
<h3><strong>1- Shanghumukham Beach</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 8 km from Trivandrum city.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Free.</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open 24/7 (best during daylight).</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 15–20 min drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Sunset/sunrise, Sagarakanyaka sculpture, peaceful beach walks.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9591" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shanghumukham-Beach.jpg" alt="Shanghumukham Beach" width="900" height="551" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shanghumukham-Beach.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shanghumukham-Beach-300x184.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shanghumukham-Beach-768x470.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>While the entire expanse of Kerala abounds in beaches that make for really famous tourist destinations, it’s indeed a surprise that a sandy expanse as definitive as the Shanghumukham beach in Trivandrum remains only a rare phenomenon when it comes to being one of the must visit places with the typical touristry appeal. In its white sands and exclusivity, the beach really is a splendid place to be in- one where you can remain unfazed by the bustle of life as well as the clamour of existence.</p>
<p>An exquisite shoreline, vistas of serenity, beholding sunrise views and impeccable sunset experiences, there is no wonder of nature that Shanghumukham beach does not delight its visitors with. A very striking presence in this picturesque, isolated beach is an exemplary mermaid- the Sagarakanyaka &#8211; sculpted by renowned Indian sculptor Kanayi Kunhiraman. Also an exclusive location of the Arattu festival, the spectacular beach is undoubtedly a prime presence in the capital region of Kerala.</p>
<h3><strong>2- Poovar</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 30 km south of Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Free (boat rides extra).</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 1-hour drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Boat rides, visit floating cottages, explore beaches.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9590" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Poovar-Backwaters.jpg" alt="Poovar Backwaters" width="900" height="511" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Poovar-Backwaters.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Poovar-Backwaters-300x170.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Poovar-Backwaters-768x436.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Poovar might be a tourist town in Trivandrum but it still remains among the rare places to visit given that it sits at a very southernmost point of the district. The magnificent beach that Poovar houses however is relatively well known. With its stunning natural beauty complemented perfectly by the pleasant weather, Poovar should make for a really ideal holiday detour. A pretty coastal village, more accurately an island, the view from Poovar encompasses the mighty Neyyar river confluencing into the vast expanse of the Arabian Sea. Naturally with the sea at sway, Poovar also sports a luxurious beach along the trails of its coconut palms lined glorious sands.</p>
<p>The rustic charm of Poovar complements perfectly the growing luxury appeal of its many star rated establishments, thereby presenting tourists with a delightful mix of the pristine and the pure, the elegant and the mesmerising. There’s diverse flora and fauna at play, while even the seemingly ordinary sights are no less spectacular; coconut groves, fishermen going about their chores, floating cottages- all present a picture of a heaven hitherto undiscovered. There’s even an alluring estuary nearby Poovar that remains resplendent also in the same relaxing vibe and natural abundance. In its yet unspoilt confines, Poovar harbours an aura that caters to every touristry desire- of the quaint and the peaceful as also of the picturesque and the magical.</p>

<h3><strong>3- Neyyar Dam</strong></h3>

<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: ₹10–₹20.</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>

</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9589" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Neyyar-Dam.jpg" alt="Neyyar Dam" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Neyyar-Dam.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Neyyar-Dam-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Neyyar-Dam-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>An idyllic spot for a relaxing day out in the open, the Neyyar dam is a man-made wonder that makes for among the rare places to visit in Trivandrum. In fact, Neyyar is a lake cum dam that is built over the Neyyar River and makes for a really enthralling spot encompassed by the Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary. With the breathtaking Western Ghats as the backdrop, the Neyyar Dam makes for a really amazing picnic place.</p>
<p>The panoramic presence of the lake amidst the majestic standing of the dam makes this place a marvel in many wonders. Undisturbed by the chaos of the world and deep seated in its offering of splendid serenity and unbounded natural bounty, the region makes for a really enchanting place to while away your Trivandrum sojourn. There’s obviously rich flora and diverse fauna inhabiting this ecologically vibrant place. But the Neyyar dam and the surrounding locality also houses many rare medicinal herbs within its offbeat ambit. For visitors to the capital of God’s very own country, this is one rare discovery that will leave you deeply satiated and immensely rejuvenated.</p>
<h3><strong>4- Veli Lake and Tourist Village</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 12 km from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: ₹10–₹20 (boat rides extra).</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 20 min drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Boat rides, floating bridge, photography.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9592" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Veli-Lake.jpg" alt="Veli Lake" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Veli-Lake.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Veli-Lake-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Veli-Lake-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Among the most charming lakes in Kerala yet only a rare tourist attraction, the Veli Lake should certainly be among the list of places you would visit on a <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/trivandrum-tour-packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trip to Trivandrum</a>. Located some 12 kilometers away from the city, the tourist village is a really pretty destination with its locational nestling at the confluence of the Veli Lake and the Arabian Sea. In fact the village sits pretty exotically on the sand bar that separates the two water bodies and oversees therefore the crystal waters of the underlying lagoon.</p>
<p>There’s ample activities that you can indulge in the many waters that define the allure of Veli. In its splendid stretch of backwaters and the lush expanse of its many paddy fields, the scene is one of a breathtaking contrast on canvas. Shades of green as vivid as the strokes of blue define this quaint place that is a visual treat to savor in all its glory. A floating bridge and some amazing stone and grass sculptures further up the exotic quotient of this charming place that definitely is a worthy tourist attraction in all its exquisite offerings.</p>
<h3><strong>5- Kappil Backwater</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 7 km from Varkala.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Free (boat rides extra).</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 20-30 min drive from Varkala.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Walk along the estuary, enjoy sunsets, boat rides.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9587" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kappil-Backwater.jpg" alt="Kappil Backwater" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kappil-Backwater.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kappil-Backwater-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kappil-Backwater-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The Kappil backwaters aren’t exactly among the rare tourist places in Trivandrum but compared to how abundantly explored backwaters in Kerala tend to be, it does not exactly feature as one of the must visit attractions. Situated a mere 7 kilometers away from the very popular beach destination of Varkala, the sheen of the Kappil backwaters seem to remain mired in relative obscurity. In fact the majestic beauty of the backwaters together with the astounding expanse of the sea makes also the Kappil beach a tourist destination of unparalleled magnificence altogether. Amazing sunset and sunrise views further compound the beauty of this place that remains resplendent even in its largely relaxing vibe.</p>
<p>The Kappil Pozhi estuary that separates the sea from the backwaters makes for an amazing walkway, one where you can enjoy a leisurely stroll even as panoramic views and the gentle sea breeze soothes your body and soul. The coconut lined sandy strip makes for such a stunning view that the place remains one of the most photographed across Kerala! Reclusive in its touristry presence yet not in any way lacking in the appeal, hardly would you discover a beauty like Kappil even in your sojourn across the world.</p>
<h3><strong>6- Kowdiar Palace</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: Kowdiar, Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Not open to the public.</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: N/A.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Year-round.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 5 km from the city center.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Admire architecture from outside.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9404" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum.jpg" alt="Kowdiar Palace, Trivandrum" width="900" height="590" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum-768x503.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>That Kerala is mainly celebrated as a land of verdant greenery and swaying waters, of beachy allure and coastal glory perhaps explains why an architectural specimen as striking as the Kowdiar Palace in Trivandrum makes for among the rare places that tourists tend to visit. In its structure, the palace is a simple manifestation of architecture, yet it is by no means any less exemplary a specimen than other flamboyant illustrations. Even historically the Kowdiar Palace holds significance as Maharajah Sree Chithira Thirunal built it for the wedding of his only sister, Maharani Karthika Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi.</p>
<p>A really unique wooden structure, one that even boasts an elevator made of wood, the Kowdiar Palace makes for a grand sight even in its ‘rooted’ existence. A three storeyed building that rears its majestic bearings from among the verdant expanse of Trivandrum, the palace is a lofty sight with its six steeples and an equally breathtaking wonder in the picturesque garden of greenery that nestles it. The Kowdiar Palace indeed is an encompassment of the simplicity that describes Kerala, flamboyant in its natural endowment and alluring even in its minimalism. There truly is no ode to beauty that does Trivandrum better humanly than the Kowdiar Palace.</p>
<h3><strong>7- Azhimala Beach</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: Near Kovalam (25 km from Trivandrum).</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Free.</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Mar.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 30 min drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Beach walks, visit Azhimala Shiva Temple, sunset views.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9585" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Azhimala-Beach.jpg" alt="Azhimala Beach" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Azhimala-Beach.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Azhimala-Beach-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Azhimala-Beach-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Azhimala might be another of the many beaches that dot Kerala but in its quiet splendor it remains one of those rare places that needs to be a feature of the itinerary of every visit to Trivandrum. Just some few kilometers away from the world class appeal of Kovalam, the allure of Azhimala resides in its quaint, calm existence that renders it nothing short of a paradise. The setting is one that is undoubtedly idyllic, the vibe permeating through its serene prettiness speaks of solace and contentment, and in the expanse of almost nothingness would you encounter a peace so alluring that you would want to stay there forever. Of course there are coconut fringed shores that sit pretty daintily with the majestic Azhimala hill as the backdrop. There also is the Azhimala Shiva Temple nearby for you to seek spirituality in, intermingled with solace and tranquility.</p>
<h3><strong>8- Bonacaud</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 40 km from Trivandrum, in the Agasthya Hills.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Free (trekking requires permission).</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 1.5–2 hours drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Trekking, visit tea estate, explore waterfalls.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9586" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bonacaud-Estate.jpg" alt="Bonacaud Estate" width="900" height="518" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bonacaud-Estate.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bonacaud-Estate-300x173.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bonacaud-Estate-768x442.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>A small village hamlet in Trivandrum, Bonacaud is also a really pretty picnic spot. A sprawling encompassment of natural beauty in its array of valleys, waterfalls and hills, Bonacaud also is the lesser known base station of the famous peak, Agasthyarkoodam in the Agasthya hills of the Western Ghats. What however strikes a different tone amidst the abundant beauty and verdance tract that defines every aspect of Kerala and also bonacaud is the presence of supposedly among the most haunted places in the state. That’s a chill that the Bonacaud Bungalow encompasses, that in its misty presence and obscure existence stands very much as a ghostly ground. There also however exists an abandoned tea factory that also adds its own dose of horror to Bonacaud.</p>
<p>Naturally in its abundant peaks and trails, Bonacaud is also a trekker’s paradise. Flora and fauna dot the region as does gurgling streams and crystal waters making it the true encompassment of nature in all its vibrancy. Bonacaud perhaps is no different than any other touristry attractions in Kerala, yet it remains one of the rare places to visit in Trivandrum if you are a soul forever in awe of as much of natural exuberance as the world can grant.</p>
<h3><strong>9- Muthalapozhi</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 29 km from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Mar.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 45 min drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Visit estuary, sunset views, beach walks</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9588" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Muthalapozhi-Port.jpg" alt="Muthalapozhi Port" width="900" height="580" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Muthalapozhi-Port.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Muthalapozhi-Port-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Muthalapozhi-Port-768x495.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>A seaside village that rests just 29 kilometers away from the city of Trivandrum, Muthalapozhi might not strike exactly as a tourist wonder with its seemingly ordinary stature which is why it finds expression as one of the rare places to visit in Trivandrum. But as the place that defines the confluence of the Vamanapuram River and the Arabian Sea, the sleepy hamlet sure is no walkover either. Like all other places that emerge to be prettier with the merge of the backwaters and the sea, Muthalapozhi also is steeped in all of that exquisite beauty. An unending seascape, really stunning sunset views, an array of beach activities and unending allure of serenity- Trivandrum sure couldn’t have got any more ordinarily exotic than this!</p>
<h3><strong>10- Ponmudi</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 60 km northeast of Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 2-hour drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Trekking, visit tea gardens, photography.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9594" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ponmudi.jpg" alt="Ponmudi" width="900" height="519" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ponmudi.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ponmudi-300x173.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ponmudi-768x443.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Ponmudi might be exactly the rarest of places to visit for a tourist, but as a hill station with all the charms it still dwells somewhere in obscurity. A mist covered valley that harbours the robust allure of the teas and also the prettiness of its ample floral diversity, Ponmudi is a really captivating vista of all-encompassing beauty. Sitting conveniently at some 60 kilometers from Trivandrum, Ponmudi definitely is worthy of your visit as among the rare places that has all the elements of making you feel like you are in the midst of true blue paradise.</p>

<p>Kerala is called God’s own country and it is one of the most special tourist destinations in India. The Western Ghats mountain range separates the coastal strip that forms Kerala from the rest of South India, and this is where Munnar is located at 1600 meters altitude from sea level. Members of the British colonial administration in India used to retreat to this hill station to escape the summer heat in South India, and today Munnar is still a very popular destination especially when the summer heat becomes unbearable in lower altitudes around April and May.</p>
<h3><strong>Things to Do in Munnar</strong></h3>
<p>The Western Ghats are known as one of the main tea, coffee and spice growing regions in this part of India. The mountain climate is perfect for growing tea and coffee, and Munnar itself is a centre of the South Indian tea industry. Miles of tea plantations spread around the town and visitors are welcome to stop at many plantations, to see how tea is grown and to sample local varieties. India is one of the main tea growing countries in the world and the Munnar region in Kerala is one of the important tea producing areas in the country along with Assam and Darjeeling in the northeast of India.</p>
<p>Tea, or chai, is the most popular drink in India and much of India’s tea comes from this region. You can sample local tea, made with lots of milk and sugar, at tea stalls, restaurants and everywhere you go. Sometimes tea is flavored with spices that grow in the region’s spice plantations, from cardamom and cinnamon to ginger and black pepper, and is then called masala chai. Many resorts and hotels at Munnar are located in the middle of tea plantations or spice farms, and often arrange visits to the plantations.</p>
<p>Coffee and spices grow in the hills too, and even though tea is India’s main beverage, South India’s residents like their coffee too. Local grown spices include the exotic ginger, cinnamon, black pepper and Kerala’s specialty, green cardamom. Spices are grown for local use but also for export. When visiting the area, don’t forget to try local food that is spiced up with the exotic flavors of cinnamon and cardamom.</p>
<p>Three mountain streams (the Kudala, the Nallathanni and the Mudrapuzha) meet in Munnar and contribute to the picturesque scenery. Munnar is a great area for hiking, and trekking paths lead through green forests, idyllic mountain scenery and small villages. The Anamudi peak at 2695 meters altitude is South India’s highest peak and famous amongst trekkers in this area. Day treks and longer trips are arranged by many hotels in Munnar and by local travel agents.</p>
<h3><strong>Places to Visit around Munnar</strong></h3>
<p>The Mattupetty Lake and the Kundala Lake are picturesque spots for daytrips and for picnics. Both are surrounded by tea plantations. In Mattupetty you can also take a boat trip on the Mattupetty Dam. Pothamedu, just outside Munnar, is known for green and lush scenery, perfect for walking and hiking, and for cardamom, coffee and tea plantations. Devikulam is another nearby hill station and is famous for the pretty Sita Devi Lake. Attukal has some idyllic waterfalls and the Rajamala area is a good place for spotting the local mountain goat, the rare Nilgiri tahr. For more wildlife spotting, head to the Eravikulam National Park, just 15 kilometres from Munnar and a good place for a short trek or even a relaxed walk.</p>
<h4><strong>Munnar Travel Information</strong></h4>
<p>The nearest airports are in Madurai and Coimbatore. The easiest way to travel is to rent a car with a driver. If you have booked a hotel in Munnar, ask if the hotel can recommend a travel agent for booking a car. Many Munnar hotels also offer airport pick-ups for their guests.</p>
<p>The main tourist season in Munnar is between August and May. The southeast monsoon brings heavy rain to the area from June, and the rains can continue until September. After the monsoon the nature is at its greenest and most beautiful. If you are traveling to the region around November and December, keep in mind those nights can be cold in this altitude and temperatures can drop down to 0 degrees Celsius. Remember to pack warm clothes and some waterproof clothing and shoes for visiting Munnar.		</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kerala is a land of mesmerizing natural beauty. Be its hill stations or its backwaters or its temples, the land always beckons a passionate traveller. And if you love beaches, there are many in Kerala to fascinate you thoroughly. Learn about the top Kerala beaches from the article below-</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Kerala-Backwaters.jpg" alt="Kerala-Backwaters" width="575" height="384" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5346" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Kerala-Backwaters.jpg 575w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Kerala-Backwaters-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Kerala-Backwaters-165x110.jpg 165w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Kerala-Backwaters-370x247.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" /></p>
<p>Known for its backwaters and silver beaches, Kerala doesn’t fail to charm its visitors. Here is a list of some of the top ten beaches of Kerala that call the ever thirsty traveller’s mind.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Kizhunna Ezhara Beach</strong></h3>
<p>Situated close to Kannur, Kerala, the twin beaches of Kizhunna Ezhara Beach are very little known and hence less frequented. The golden hue of the sands along the coastline and the sea water, together create a beautiful ballad of beauty and ecstasy. The place is a delight for the tourists and also the picnickers who travel from far and near.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Kozhikode Beach</strong></h3>
<p>Sunrise and sundown are the two most significant moments that make for the most memorable occasions spent on beaches. This sea beach is several notches higher when it comes to experiencing both of these here. Dolphin’s Point offers the visitors a golden chance to spend with the dolphins. The lighthouse, the aquarium, and the Lion’s Park are other favourites of the tourists. If these aren’t enough, there are also two main piers that stand on the beach. These piers were built in the 19thcentury.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Lighthouse Beach</strong></h3>
<p>Kovalam is rich in beaches. One of its priced ones is the Lighthouse beach. The beach owes its name to a historic lighthouse that stands here on a hilltop. The place is dotted with several luxurious hotels that promise to offer that much-needed respite tourists crave for. The place is gorgeous with the options of having a visual treat of the beauty nature shows off here, as well as the various water games and activities that are available for one and all.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Papanasam Beach</strong></h3>
<p>This beach is also popular by the name, Varkala beach. It is one of the budget tourist locations where the tourists can go on a short trip with minimum expenditure. Winters are the most expensive, and the busiest time to go here. However, at other time of the year, it is quiet and serene. The place also has cliffs which add to its exotic beauty. The word ‘Papanasam’ means that the waters of this beach can purify one of his sins, by having a bath in this holy water. Apart from these, water games and activities are already on the list.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Poovar Beach</strong></h3>
<p>This beach certainly qualifies as one of the top places to visit in Kerala. Kerala is known for its backwaters, and Poovar confirms it doubly. There are a number of fishing activities, and hence there aren’t any water sports and activities. But that shouldn’t deter the tourists because once there, the place itself can engage one in its breath-taking beauty. With traditional Marshal Arts, and some swirling boat rides amidst the lagoons, forests, and groves no one will ever miss the water activities which are a common feature in every beach.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Shankumugham Beach</strong></h3>
<p>It is noted for its white crystals of sand and pristine water. A sunset view at the beach is worth a thousand visits at the beach. The beach is also famous for a mermaid (MatsyaKanya)! No, not a real one though, but a very renowned sculpture by a great sculptor of the land. The place is simple away from the hustle and bustle but still manages to catch an eye of the visitors. With some South Indian snacks, a cup of coffee, and the spread of coconut trees all around, make a perfect company for those who are avid sunset watchers.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Kollam Beach</strong></h3>
<p>The beach stretches in the Kollam city. It is characterized by the famous lighthouse that it upholds, the marine aquarium, and the beautiful evening view with the setting sun at the backdrop. There are excellent resorts and hotels present on the beach which promise to provide good times of rest, comfort, and relaxation to the weary tourists.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Kappil Beach</strong></h3>
<p>Relax! If this is all your restless mind is directing you to do, then Kappil beach is the top choice. The place is thoroughly unexplored and hence the least commercialized. If the cities have taken a toll on the minds, and the heart feels wretchedly ill, Kappil beach will work wonders as a sanatorium to gather oneself together.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Kolavipalam Beach</strong></h3>
<p>Calm and serene, clear waters, clean sandy beach. If all these don’t appeal much then there is yet another reason to pack the bags for a tour at Kolavipalam Beach. This beach is famed to be the habitat of Olive Ridley Turtle. Hence the name, Turtle Beach. This Kozhikode beach becomes the den for the turtles during their breeding season (September-March). The local fishermen and residents toil really hard to keep steady the dwindling number of these endangered turtle species.</p>
<h3><strong>10. Valiathura Beach</strong></h3>
<p>Very much accessible by rail, road, and air, this beach is located in close proximity to the capital city of Kerala, Trivandrum, and is also close to Shankumugham Beach. Valiathura is known for fishing and is also known as the fisherman’s beach. This used to be an active port at a time in history unlike now. It is also known for its tall pier.</p>
<p>For the sea lovers, these beaches in Kerala are ideal to voyage out amidst the crimson evening sky, azure water, and pearl white sand.</p>
