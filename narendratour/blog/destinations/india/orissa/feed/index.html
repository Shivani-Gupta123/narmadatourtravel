										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The wonder of nature that India as a country is, it is no surprise that each of the states and union territories that shape the landscape and make up her identity have all been equal amalgamations of fascinating diversity with of course the common thread of unity binding them all. From the sparkling waters of the coastal glory that the southern states embody to the magical mirage of glittering beauty characterising the northernmost part of the country, traversing miles of eastern territory sequined in swards and fluent in foliage to arriving at heaps of shining sands and unending unconventionalities of food and cuisine, India is a diverse nation as it can get. But even in its diversity and the unity through which it glides, the country harbours quite a few aberrations that however only sums up the beauty of its benevolent natural bestowing.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9451" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi.jpg" alt="Daringbadi" width="900" height="552" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-300x184.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-768x471.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h3><strong>The Allure of Daringbadi</strong></h3>
<p>So while that might mean setting out to astonishingly explore lesser-known <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/underrated-world-heritage-sites-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Heritage Sites</a> or plunging in all in the many paragliding avenues it offers, there also dwells such beckonings that seem quite out of place. That does not however discount even a bit of the bountiful beauty these surprising places seat radiant in with all aplomb. And while any mention of offbeat, lesser explored places of India conjures up in mind a lush image of the serene north-eastern region, there also exists equally unique destinations in the Indian mainland that can catch you off guard with their diversive dimension. And one such place in India that will definitely be a world of wonder to unravel in all its picture-perfect prettiness is Daringbadi.</p>
<h3><strong>The Unique Charm of Daringbadi</strong></h3>
<p>What makes this <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/tourist-places-in-orissa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">place in Odisha</a> instantly endearing to nature lovers and tourists is its peculiar distinction. As the only region in the eastern Indian state that receives snowfall, Daringbadi will delight you to no end. Just imagine, vistas of gorgeous greenery lacquered in thin sheets of snow within a state that gets as hot as it can! As a <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/famous-indian-hill-stations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hill station</a>, Daringbadi offers all it can in terms of its picturesque expanse and pleasant ambience. So much so that in all its charm and cheer, the place has even come to be known as the ‘Kashmir of Odisha’. With an epithet so coveted, Daringbadi does offer you all the reasons to go tripping in its luxuriant threshold of natural abundance at least once in your lifetime.</p>
<h3><strong>Enigmatic Beauty and Natural Treasures</strong></h3>
<p>In its definite enigma as a hill station, Daringbadi is very much an envelope of treasures lesser encountered in this part of the country. Refreshing greens, hazy mists, splendid scenery, cool climes—this popular tourist destination is a gem. Situated at a height of 3000 feet, this verdant region is surrounded by the lush green hills of Phulbani on one side. In Odisha’s Kandhamal district, Daringbadi sits pretty not just in the carousel of its greens and the pleasantries of its appeal. The region is as much of a haven in its pine forests and coffee plantations, not to mention its many waterfalls and rivers and of course its simplistic tribal population.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9450" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-the-Kashmir-of-Odisha.jpg" alt="Daringbadi, the Kashmir of Odisha" width="900" height="550" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-the-Kashmir-of-Odisha.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-the-Kashmir-of-Odisha-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-the-Kashmir-of-Odisha-768x469.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h3><strong>The Magic of Frost and Charm</strong></h3>
<p>Named after a British officer Daring Sahab who was in charge of the place, it however would not be entirely correct to celebrate the beauty of Daringbadi as one that allures with its snowy expanse. Rather it is the ammil or the layer of frost and ice that covers the grass and the greens and makes it sparkle as if it were snow. However, even with or without some real snowflakes settling on its misty meadows and vibrant valleys, Daringbadi is no less magical a place to lose yourselves in. In its quaint charm and luxuriant beauty, this hill station in <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/odisha" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Odisha</a> is an equal wonder you would end up raving about.</p>

<h3><strong>The Serenity of Doluri River</strong></h3>
<p>Another watery expanse that crisscrosses its majestic way through the expanse of a scenic Daringbadi is the equally scenic Doluri River. Originating from the forest slopes, the river serves as a pretty trekking route as well. Flowing calmly across rocks and accommodating a series of smaller waterfalls, this sightly manifestation in the confines of a land as majestic in its beauty is sure a treat to devour for the soul and the senses.</p>
<h3><strong>Enchanted Pines and Diverse Greens</strong></h3>
<p>Like any other hill station on earth, Daringbadi is magically set apart by its psithurism of the pines. As soon as you set foot in this magical abode of surreal splendor in a land characterised otherwise by the sea, sands, and the sun, the mysticism of a dense growth of pine trees will take you aback with its otherworldly magic. Rising tall and green from the rich red soils of the hills, this entire canopy of dark lure will do to your senses what not even the most exuberant hues can. In discovering the dark enchantment of the pines, Daringbadi helps you to discover your inner peace and calm.</p>

With also Mahua trees blooming in wild abundance, you finally gain a sense of the intoxication that a mere tryst with Daringbadi is enough to have you craving for.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9449" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-Hill-Station.jpg" alt="Daringbadi Hill Station" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-Hill-Station.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-Hill-Station-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Daringbadi-Hill-Station-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<h3><strong>The Hill View Point Experience</strong></h3>
<p>The most popular vantage point in Daringbadi, from where you can take in the ample beauty of the place in a realization quite distinctive, is the Hill View Point. Whether you are an avid trekker or a pure nature enthusiast, the ascent up this vantage point will reward you with such sights and experiences that will make your Daringbadi trip all the more worthwhile. For panoramic sunrises and romantic sunsets or for simply a magnificent all-round view of the pristine place called Daringbadi, a visit to Hill View Point is a must.</p>

<p>While at the Hill View Point, make it also a point to explore the Hill View Nature Park and the Butterfly Park.

<h3><strong>The Serenity of Lover’s Point</strong></h3>
<p>There’s another place in Daringbadi with the ‘Point’ suffix that is a prime tourist attraction. Known as Lover’s Point, this rocky facade with the waters streaming past in all its gurgling fantasy and quiet tranquility is truly one of the places that will make you fall in love. A very calm, silent spot where you can just sit down and watch the river as it makes its way past the grey of the rocks amidst the green of the terrains, Lover’s Point is a different beauty altogether. Even in being very uncharacteristic of a hill station, Lover’s Point will actually make you feel all the more grateful for stumbling upon the elusive gem called Daringbadi.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: A Hidden Gem</strong></h3>
<p>A tribal hinterland and one that smells of the rustic essence of nature in its simplistic way to life, Daringbadi is but a serene hamlet. Picturesque to perfection, calming to a point that is almost riveting and all the more special in its variegated claim to touristry fame, this is a place emerging from the land of beaches and temples in a manner so redolent of the misty musing of snowy precincts that has led it to be eulogised in stature to the extant heaven on earth that is Kashmir. Indeed in its spectacular indulgent facade of the charms and chills, Daringbadi is as dreamy as any earthy place can possibly be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Konark home to the Sun Temple, amazing one third of Orissa Golden Triangle.</p>
<p>Temples, architectural and cultural tours are some of rich enticing travel attractions Konark has to offer.</p>
<h3><strong>History of Konark</strong></h3>
<p>The history of Konark in the eastern region of India is entwined with the legendary Sun Temple. The name itself has meaning related to the Sun-Konark a combination ‘Kona’ which means corner and ‘Arka’ stands for the sun, the leading to the meaning corner of sun. The befitting name is testament to the district’s firm establishment as a centre for worshipping the sun.</p>
<p>The earliest reference to Konark can be found in the epic Purana where it was called Mundira and a sun temple had already existed civilizations ago. With its coastal location near Bay of Bengal, it was also a busy port that enjoyed good relations with the Southeast Asian regions. The most notable period in Konark history is in the 13th century when the King Narasimhadeva I of the Ganga dynasty completed the construction of the monumental Sun temple to commemorate their victory over the Muslims.</p>
<h3><strong>Tourism in Konark</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Temples</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2968" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Konark-Sun-Temple-Odisha.jpg" alt="Konark Sun Temple, Odisha" width="700" height="379" /><br />
Konark, in the eastern region of India, is synonymous with the grand Sun Temple, an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Despite its ancient state, the majestic temple still stands tall in full splendor as one can only be filled with awe at the architectural masterpiece. The red sandstone roof rises to a towering height of 30m. The temple is built to resemble the divine chariot used as by Surya, the Sun God, hence the name. This chariot temple was to have been pulled by 7 horses, to represent the days in the week. Only a single horse structure remains standing. The base of the chariot is supported by 24 stone wheels, to represent the hours in a day. The intricate carvings on these wheels are another sight to marvel. There are 8 spokes on each wheel, which have proven to be accurate sundials as they are able to indicate the time of the day perfectly. All around the temple, there are erotic sculptures and other figures of deities, noblemen and animals depicting various scenes.</p>
<p>Other remarkable temples worth the travel include the Melakadambur Shiva Temple, built in 11th century, the one of Konark’s oldest chariot temples and closely resembles the Sun temple. Mayadevi Temple, also referred as Ramachandi temple, is believed to be built in dedication to one of the wives of the Sun God. The walls of this ancient temple are carved with erotic figurines of dancing nymphs, motifs of flowers, scenes of the court and hunting sessions.</p>
<p><strong>The Museum and Beach</strong></p>
<p>The Archaeological Museum of Konark is a must visit, following the tour to the Sun Temple. Founded in 1968 and with four marvelous galleries, this museum is home to varying stone sculptures, artifacts and intricate carvings numbering over 200. The archaeological finds of the detached sculptures from the Sun temple are displayed in the first gallery. The amazing embellishments on the sculptures of the Hindu deities, the meticulous display of various scenes, cult objects and interesting artifacts such as roaring lions and garlanded swans are nothing short of impressive craftsmanship. The museum is a fertile learning ground about Orissa’s architectural evolution and development.</p>
<p>Konark beach, which is also called Chandrabhaga, is a very popular travel spot. The tranquil settings among the strong waves and clear sand will naturally evoke a sense of peace to any traveler.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most primitive aspects in art, music and dance are the art forms known to the mankind since time immemorial. Music and dance are deeply ingrained in any society universally. In Hindu mythology, the cosmic dance performance or the Tandava Nritya of Lord Shiva and the stories of Lord Krishna dancing with Radha and Gopis are popular myths. Like in any other part of India, Orissa has a glorious tradition of music and dance and has its own distinct school. Apart from the classical Odissi Dance, there are numerous folk dances usually performed during fairs, festivals and religious ceremonies.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6250" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Gita-Govinda-manusc.jpg" alt="Gita Govinda manusc" width="494" height="345" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Gita-Govinda-manusc.jpg 494w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Gita-Govinda-manusc-300x210.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Gita-Govinda-manusc-158x110.jpg 158w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Gita-Govinda-manusc-358x250.jpg 358w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px" /><br />
<strong>Music</strong><br />
The treatise of Bharata, a pioneer of music and dance in India refers to the musical tradition of Odra substantiated by archaeological finds from the times (1st century BC) of Chedi dynasty. The innumerable sculptures of musical instruments depicted on the walls of temples from 6th century AD to 13th century AD testify to the glorious tradition of music and its patronage by successive kingdom in Orissa. The classical Odissi Music owes much to the great Saint poet, Jayadeva, whose highly lyrical Geet Govind, composed in Sanskrit in the 12th century was ritually sung in many of these temples. By the 15th century instead of Sanskrit, Oriya language was being used for literary works and the poetry developed on the love theme of Radha and Krishna. The musical forms like Chhanda, chautisa, champu, chaupadi, bhajan and janana had developed. The period between 16-19th century under the local patronage saw great composers of lyrical music based on raga (tune) and tala (beat). Treatises on music like-Sangitarnava, Chandrika, Gita Prakasha, Sangita Kalpalata, Sangita Sarani and Sangita Narayana were compiled.</p>
<p>In modern time some greatest exponents have significantly contributed to the development and modernization of Odissi music, prominent among them are Singhari Shyamasundar Kar, Markandeya Mahapatra, Kasinath Pujapanda, Balakrushna Das, Gopal Chand Panda, Damodar Hota, Ramahari Das, Shyamamani Devi Sumati Devi, Sunanda Patnaik, Keshab, Sangeeta Gosain, Bijoy Jena and others.</p>
<h3><strong>Dances</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Odissi Dance</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6251" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/odissi-dance.jpeg" alt="odissi dance" width="800" height="448" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/odissi-dance.jpeg 800w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/odissi-dance-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/odissi-dance-768x430.jpeg 768w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/odissi-dance-170x95.jpeg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/odissi-dance-370x207.jpeg 370w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/odissi-dance-288x160.jpeg 288w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/odissi-dance-780x437.jpeg 780w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><br />
Odissi is one of the six classical dance forms of India with a very distinct elegance and poise associated with its style. It finds mention in the Natya Shashtra of Bharata, as Odra-Magadhi style. Friezes in the caves of Udayagiri and Khandagiri and the sculptures of female dancers found in large numbers in temples attest to the popularity of dances in courts and places of worship as far back as the 2nd century BC. It was an integral part of the religious rituals performed in the nata mandapas by the maharis or devadasis (temple dancers) in their elaborate costumes and jewellery.</p>
<p>The history of Odissi dance has a bearing with devadasis (wives of the God) of Lord Jagannath. Devadasis were handed over by their parents at an early age and were symbolically married to presiding deity. Jayadev’s Geet Govind, dealing largely with the depths of Krishna’s love for Radha was part of the daily religious rituals, performed by devadasis with different bhavas and rasas. With the loss independence of the Orissa by the end of the 16th century, the mahari tradition declined. The Ray Ramananda, a dramatist and musician introduced the dance in another form, Gotipua Nacha, where males dressed as Girls danced outside the temple. Thus the tradition survived and it came out of the temple. Most of the earlier time gurus (masters) were Gotipua dancers. The 15th century manual, Abhinaya Chandrika, written by Maheswara Mahapatra contains information about the technique of Odissi dance and was also instrumental in reviving the old glory of Orissa’s own regional style along with temple sculptures. All the poses, steps and movements in Odissi dance have been codified and preserved by the Odissi Research Centre established by Government of Orissa at Bhubaneswar.</p>
<p>Beautifully attired in pleated silk brocades, bejeweled and decked in jasmine flowers and bells, the dancers perform to the recitation of devotional poetry set to music, most inspired form the theme of eternal love of Radha Krishna. The important parts of Odissi Dance are called Padabhada, bumi, chari, biramani, bhangi and hasta (mudra) etc. the most typical pose is tribhanga (hip shot stance) where the body is bent thrice, the fundamental posture is chawki and the dance is divided into nritta (pure dance), nritya (expressional dance) and natya (drama). The different items of the Odissi dance style in the order in which they are performed are mangalacharana, batu nrutya, pallavi, abhinaya and mokshapat. In mangalacharana, the dancer dedicated herself to the Lord Ganesha or Lord Jagannath, begs forgiveness of the Mother Earth for stamping her feet upon her and of her audience for any shortcoming in the performance and offers salutations to the Guru. The batu nritya is pure dance, lying stress on poses symbolizing the playing of the veena, drum, flute or cymbals, without any recitation or song. The extremely graceful and lyrical is pallavi, the tune in some raga accompanied by sargam and bols. Through facial expressions, abhinaya, the performer depicts rasa and bhava to bring out the meaning and mood of the accompanying song either in Sanskrit or in Oriya. These romantic compositions are generally from the pieces of Geet Govind, the dashavatar item or the songs written by poets like Banamali, Upendera Bhanja, Baladeva Rath and Gopala etc. the concluding piece of performance, mokshapat has a fast tempo to the accompaniment of rhythmic patterns, which transports the dancer to moksha (merger with divine).</p>
<p><strong>Performing Arts</strong><br />
Orissa has a rich tradition of folk plays – dance, drama and music in which the spiritual, philosophical and the humane dimensions have merged to reflect a life style.</p>
<p>A religious folk play, it is a popular form of devotional entertainment. The Ram Leela portrays the various incidents from the epic Ramayana. The dramatic rendering of dialogues by the performing artistes in dazzling costumes and heavy make-up backed by a group of chorus singers and orchestral music starts from the Ram Navami day and continues for 9 nights. The Ras Leela is a lyrical-musical enactment of the immortal love of Lord Krishna and his consort Radha. It revolves around different moods of love, such as anger, playfulness, expectation etc between the two.</p>
<p>Other popular form is Bharat Leela or Dwari Leela which draws its plot from the story of love and subsequent marriage of Arjuna – one of the five Pandavas with Subhadra. A typical play of Ganjam district, the Prahlad Natak, a play composed by Gopinath Parichha is presented a s a compendium of songs in praise of Lord Nrusingha and suppression of pride of demon king Hiranya Kashyap by a young devout Prahlad.</p>
<p><strong>Jatra (Yatra)</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6252" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Performing-Daskathia.jpg" alt="Performing Daskathia" width="640" height="380" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Performing-Daskathia.jpg 640w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Performing-Daskathia-300x178.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Performing-Daskathia-170x101.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Performing-Daskathia-370x220.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><br />
It corresponds to folk theater where mythological, historical and social subjects are enacted. In fact, Jatra blossomed at the end of the 19th century as a development over Suanga. Performed in an open air theatre, Jatra succeeds to enliven the mass with a show of music, dance, acting, singing and the dramatic expression of emotions like love, anxiety, anger, and pathos. Recently social themes and popular legends have also been included, with rustic characters in dazzling costumes rendering dialogues in local dialects. The theatrical mannerism and the high sounding dialogues of perfomers and the accompanying thundering music usually a harmonium, clarinet, cymbals, table, dholki, bugle and mrudanga, all liven up the atmosphere.</p>
<p>A pioneer of this art, Baishnab Pani introduced duet dances and prose dialogues in this popular art of mass entertainment but the present day plays however seem to be deeply influenced by modern cinema.</p>
<p><strong>Daskathia</strong><br />
A folk art performed by two men owes its name to the musical instrument by the same name. Daskathia is made of two wooden pieces, which when beaten with hands produce rhythmic sound. The singer like the Pala singer generally uses themes of religious intent from mythology, whereas his partner intermittently gives a rhythmic refrain of the words. The rhythmic narration is often interspersed with special sequences dramatized in dialogue form. Wit, humour and songs take the centre stage in this performance of a shorter duration than the Pala.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Balasore was a bustling port established by British in 1642 and was an important maritime trading port also with Dutch and French, but lost its importance because the port had silted up in the 18th century. Ruins of some Dutch tombs and remnants of some old canals which led to the sea (13 km away) can still be seen.</p>
<p>Today Balasore is a growing town, well connected to both Kolkata (298) and Bhubaneswar (214) by road on NH5 and by rail on the Kolkata-Chennai main line. It is a convenient base for visit the serene and calm beach resort of Chandipur, just 16 east of Balasore.</p>
<p><strong>Chandipur</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3278" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chandipur.jpg" alt="Chandipur" width="741" height="486" /><br />
The seaside resort of Chandipur is one of Orissa’s finest beaches. The musical sway of the Casuarinas trees and creepier white sand dunes add to its seductive beauty. Chandipur is one of the few breaches of the world where the sea recedes up to 5 km daily at low tide. Chasing the waves in a jeep, when the sea retreats is unforgettable. The serene and peaceful landscape of Chandipur captivates the visitors.</p>
<h3><strong>Around Balasore</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Remuna</strong><br />
9 km from Balasore is the Khirachora Gopinath Temple at Remuna. This 19th century Vaishnava shrine is dedicated to Lord Krishna.</p>
<p>Legend has it that Lord Rama (an incarnation of Lord Vishnu) in Treta Yuga during exile for 14 years in the mountains of Chitrakoot had inscribed an image on a piece of stone to show Sita his incarnation as Krishna (Sri Gopinath) in Dwapar Yuga. The king of Puri wished to bring this holy image, named Jay Gopal to Puri. One night the Jay Gopal appeared in a dream of the King and expressed his desire to however stay at a serene spot having herds of cow, which ultimately was identified as Remuna. Thus the image was enshrined here in a temple by the King Narasingha Deva of Puri. The temple as one of the important pilgrimage spots of Vaishnava sect got sanctified by the visits of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and his spiritual guru Sri Madhabendra Puri Goswami and also by Sri Rasikananda Deva Goswami, a devoted soul. Legend also has it that the Lord Gopinath once had to steal a pot containing Khira (Rice Pudding) for his staunch devotee Madhabendra Puri Goswami and thus he assumed the name Khirachora.</p>
<p>With the Siddhashram of Madhabendra Puri Goswami, the Samadhi (the resting place) of Rasikananda Deva Goswami, the temple of Ramachandi (the village deity); Gradesaver Shiva and the river Saptaswara, all located here accord Remuna a high religious significance.</p>
<p><strong>Panchalingeswar</strong><br />
A tranquil place with its captivating beauty in the lap of nature, Panchalingeswar is 30 km from Balasore. Its name is derived from the five lingams enshrined on a hill top. A place of pilgrimage for its five phallic emblems of Lord Shiva, it also offers a heavenly pleasure in the enchanting beauty of the Devgiri mountain range. A perennial spring here is the main attraction.</p>
<p>The area is believed to be resided by Lord Rama for five days during the period of their exile, and the Sita supposedly enshrined these lingams to worship Lord Shiva. It is also identified with the Kingdom of Virat where the Pandavas lived in disguise during their exile and some associated it with the place where the King Jarasandha of Magadh built a fort in Ahuti Forest. Visitors come to enjoy the natural beauty of this hilly region. It is also famous for its two annual fairs, the nine days Magha Saptami Fair and Maha Shivratri or Jagar Fair in February/March.</p>
<p>Some other places to visit around Panchalingeswar include the famous 14th-century Bhudhara Chandi Temple at Sajanagarh, the Jagannath Temple and the Kuldiha Elephant Sanctuary in Nilgiri.</p>
<p><strong>Talasari</strong><br />
90 km from Balasore or 5 km from Chandaneswar, Talasari is the unexplored beautiful sea beach having its own ecstasy of natural landscapes.</p>
<p><strong>Baripada</strong><br />
The district headquarter of Mayurbhanj, Baripada is the main commercial town of the northeastern Orissa. The terrain is thickly forested with hills, streams and the neatly thatched villages inhabited by large tribal population, especially Santal Tribe. There are a few time worn civic building erected by the local Maharajas (Kings) during the days of British. The area for centuries has been ruled by Bhanja Kings and their old palace is now a college on the main road. There are historic sites at Khiching and Haripur where these rulers have left their marks and some prehistoric sites at Kuchai and Kuliana in the district. The colourful tribal festivals and their handicrafts like cast metal toyas and sect images and the tassar silk of this district attract the visitors. Bripada is also the gateway to Simlipal National Park, about 50 km drive away. Bhubaneswar-Baripada is about 295 km.</p>
<p>The town’s main attraction is the annual Rath Yatra in June/July associated with its Jagannath Temple, a small scale version of one that is at Puri. Its unique feature is that the Chariot of Subhadra-Lord’s sister is pulled only by women. Another colourful and vibrant annual show is the Chaitra Parba in April and it is a treat to watch tribal attired in fabulous dresses performing the vigorous Chhau dance. This dance was performed by the warriors in the past before they ventured into the battle grounds. Baripada has a small museum, exhibiting some fine sculptures, pottery, coins and other paraphernalia belonging to former Maharajas.</p>
<h3><strong>Around Baripada</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Simlipal National Park</strong><br />
50 km west of Baripada, the Simlipal National Park is one of India’s first Project Tiger reserve. It boasts around 100 tigers and some impressive wildlife spread over its total area of 2750 sq. km. the entrances to the park are at Jashipur and at Pithabata, near Lulung.</p>
<p>About 20 km west of Jashipur, Khiching was the capital of the Bhanja Kings between the 10th and 11th centuries. It is famous for its Kichakeswari Temple built entirely of chlorite slabs from the ruins of an original temple that stood here. The deity Kichakeswari was the family Goddess of the royal family of Mayurbhanj. The towering structure has superb images of several deities and the architecture of this reconstructed temple is inspired by a style prevalent in the 8th century. Nearby a number of temples built in Kalinga style still survive and are in use. The ruins of two forts of Bhanja dynasty and some Buddha images of archaeological importance have also been unearthed in this hamlet. The small Archaeological Museum preserves some outstanding life size statues of Shiva and Parvati and exquisite sculptural panels from some early age fallen temples.</p>
<p><strong>Haripur</strong><br />
16 km southeast of Bripada, Haripur was founded in 1400 as the capital by Maharaja Harihar of the Bhanja dynasty. It has the evocative ruins of some places and temples. The magnificent Rasikaraya Temple, an outstanding example of a brick-built monument is particularly noteworthy. Equally impressive are the ruins of the inner apartment of the queen, the Rani Hamsapur and of Darbar Hall with its beautiful carved stone columns and arches.</p>
<p><strong>Kumbhirgadi</strong><br />
Situated on the banks of Subarnarekha, the lingam of Baba Bhusandeswar is being worshipped for years in a remote village of Kumbhirgadi. Caved out of black granite, the lingam is about 3.8 m in height and 3.5 m in diameter, Asia’s largest, now housed in a temple constructed in 1984.</p>
<p>Legend has it that to grant the wish of the demon King Ravana, Lord Shiva gave an atmalinga to him but warned that no one can remove the lingam from where it is placed once. When Ravana was carrying the lingam to Lanka from Kailash Mountain, he felt thirsty and asked a young shepherd to hold it, the boy put it down.
