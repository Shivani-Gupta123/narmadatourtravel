										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gujarat is dotted all over with over 100 stepwells. They represent the bygone era in the form of intricate designs, skillful finish, and artistic architecture. Being the land of color, vibrancy and an eclectic lifestyle these stepwells are a major part of the wonderfully colorful <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/culture-of-gujarat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gujarati culture</a>.</p>
<p>In the olden times, these stepwells not only provided water for the locals to carry on with their daily life but they were also a place of socialization and mingling. People used to come here to discuss their life, chit-chat a while, and then leave. Some of these elaborately made stepwells also have sculptures of various gods and goddesses which shows that Gujarat has always been a deeply religious state with an incredible spiritual bend.</p>
<p>The stepwells of Gujarat are hugely underrated when it comes to places of interest here. In fact, going to any one of these stepwells will make you realize that there is more to Gujarat than just Garba, temples, and the Great Rann Of Kutch.</p>
<h2><strong>Here Are The Top Popular Stepwells of Gujarat</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Adalaj Stepwell (Gandhinagar)</li>
<li>Dada Harir Stepwell (Ahmedabad)</li>
<li>Wankaner Palace Stepwell (Rajkot)</li>
<li>Adi Kadi Vav (Junagadh)</li>
<li>Navlakha Vav (Vadodara)</li>
<li>Geban Shah’s Vav (Champaner)</li>
<li>Modhera Surya Kund (Ahmedabad)</li>
<li>Rani Ki Vav (Patan)</li>
<li>Ramkund Stepwell (Bhuj)</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>1. Adalaj Stepwell (Gandhinagar)</strong></h3>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7024" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Adalaj-Stepwell.jpg" alt="Adalaj Stepwell" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Adalaj-Stepwell.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Adalaj-Stepwell-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Adalaj-Stepwell-170x110.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Adalaj-Stepwell-370x238.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
The stepwell draws its name from the village this heritage spot is located in. A fine example of Indian architecture at its finest, Adalaj vav was built in Indo-Islamic style during 1498. The stepwell was constructed by queen Rudadevi in memory of her late husband Rana Veer Singh. Along with a water reservoir, it was also a spiritual refuge which is clear with the sculptures and engravings dedicated to spirituality. Octagonal in shape it was also a place where the locals offered prayers to the lord at the idols of deities present here. This structure is a symbol of Hindu and Jain faith and inside the stepwell, you can actually feel the air being almost 6 degrees cooler than outside. One of the highlights of this place is the finely carved-out image of a Kalpa Vriksha on a single slab of stone.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Dada Harir Stepwell (Ahmedabad)</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7026" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dada-Harir-Stepwell.jpg" alt="Dada Harir Stepwell" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dada-Harir-Stepwell.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dada-Harir-Stepwell-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dada-Harir-Stepwell-170x110.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dada-Harir-Stepwell-370x238.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Another fine example of expert Indian architecture is located 15 kms away from Ahmedabad. Dada Harir Vav was built in the year 1485 by Dhai Harir who was a superintendent of the royal harem. The well has 2 inscriptions one in Sanskrit and one in Arabic. Built using sandstone and in Solanki style of architecture, this vav is also octagonal in shape, decorated heavily with intricately carved out pillars holding it. Every floor is widely spaced out which seemed indicative of space to allow people to gather and Socialise. Dating back to around 500 years ago, and consisting of several different floors, this palace is best experienced in the morning light.  Although this place remains almost largely neglected it should be visited to see the unique features and to learn about how people back then socialized.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Wankaner Palace Stepwell (Rajkot)</strong></h3>
<p>Gracing the bend of Machhu River, Wankaner Palace stands out amidst the beautiful, wide, and open surroundings. It was built by the erstwhile British rulers during the 1930s and was used as a cool place for the royal family of Gujarat to retreat during the scorching summer heat season. Known for being one of its kind, Wankaner Palace Stepwell was built in white sandstone and currently remains one of the lesser-visited places in Gujarat. It is a fine example of a well-preserved heritage structure. Currently, the palace itself functions as a high-end palatial hotel but its glory remains intact. Wankaner is situated in Rajkot which is around 200 kms away from Ahmedabad. You either choose to stay at one of the hotel rooms here or plan a day visit to the palace and check out some nearby places of interest in Gujarat as well.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Adi Kadi Vav (Junagadh)</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7025" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Adi-Kadi-Vav.jpg" alt="Adi Kadi Vav" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Adi-Kadi-Vav.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Adi-Kadi-Vav-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Adi-Kadi-Vav-170x110.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Adi-Kadi-Vav-370x238.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Built-in the 15th century, although Adi Kadi Vav lacks the glorious intricacies of other stepwells, its history and value remains unmatched. This is one of the oldest stepwells in India and a true testament to the engineering style and smart thinking of the ancient Indian civilization. This stepwell is cut out of a single block of stone and also contains sculptures on pillars. The legend of the vav involves 2 maidens who were sacrificed under the pretext that doing so would fill up the stepwell with water. Stepwells are considered to be one of the most breakthrough developments in human progress. It is situated at a distance of around 330 kms from Ahmedabad and around some of the <a href="/blog/tourist-places-to-visit-in-gujarat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most amazing tourist destinations in Gujarat</a> like Somnath Temple and Porbandar which is the home of Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Navlakha Vav (Vadodara)</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7028" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Navlakha-Vav.jpg" alt="Navlakha Vav" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Navlakha-Vav.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Navlakha-Vav-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Navlakha-Vav-170x110.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Navlakha-Vav-370x238.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Located in one of the most iconic palaces of Gujarat, Laxmi Vilas is the Navlakha Vav. This structure is probably the only remainder of the once-Gurjar rule in Gujarat. Built during the 15th century by Sultan Muzaffar Shah the floors of the vav are intricately carved out with the lower floors being covered in Brahmi script. The stepwell got its name from the fact that 9 lakh gold coins were spent in its construction. Dating back to around 600 plus years, this vav is a must-visit to get a glimpse into the colorful and interesting past of this wonderful state. Located near Porbandar in Ghumli, it is a good place to go with your family on your way to Porbandar.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Geban Shah’s Vav (Champaner)</strong></h3>
<p>This is probably one of the most unique stepwells in Gujarat. Located in the iconic UNESCO World Heritage site of Champaner Pavagadh, this stepwell is applauded for its sophisticated water management system. It was so efficiently managed that the people residing in those never went without water, be it summer or drought season. Built during the 16th century by a fakir who went by the name of Gebanshah. With minimal ornamentation unlike the other stepwells in the state, the length pans out in an area of 50 meters on the ground floor or the lowest level. This is a simple-looking nanda-style vav which is humble, simple, and smart. This shows the forward-thinking and innovative ideas of our ancestors. This was built for use by the community with the soil in the bottom acting as a natural filter.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Modhera Surya Kund (Ahmedabad)</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7027" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Modhera-Surya-Kund.jpg" alt="Modhera Surya Kund" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Modhera-Surya-Kund.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Modhera-Surya-Kund-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Modhera-Surya-Kund-170x110.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Modhera-Surya-Kund-370x238.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Modhera is a Surya temple which graces the banks of the holy Pushpavati River. Currently standing obsolete, this temple which is dedicated to the sun god, was created way before the Konark Sun Temple in Orissa. The walls are adorned with elaborate intricate sculptures and fine works of expert craftsmanship. The temple also has engravings depicting the epics of Mahabharata and Ramayan on the walls. Every inch of this place has a story to tell. The Surya Kund is a deep-stepped tank located in front of the temple. When the temple was under swing it used to store clean water for the locals to use. Although the stepwell is completely dried up right now, during its peak years, it used to be filled with clean water through the natural underground spring. Along with the mandapas this tank was built for the purpose to serve the pilgrims.  The temple is best visited during the festive occasion of the Modhera dance festival.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Rani Ki Vav (Patan)</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6466" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rani-Ki-Vav.jpg" alt="Rani Ki Vav" width="700" height="478" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rani-Ki-Vav.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rani-Ki-Vav-300x205.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rani-Ki-Vav-161x110.jpg 161w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rani-Ki-Vav-366x250.jpg 366w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Rani Ki Vav is a UNESCO World Heritage site and is located on the banks of the holy Saraswati River. The credit for the construction of this amazing elaborate stepwell is dedicated to Udayamati who was the daughter of the king of Saurashtra, from the Solanki dynasty of Gujarat. This stepwell is an iconic heritage landmark of Gujarat and included in almost every travel plan for Gujarat. Rani Ki Vav was completely covered with silt and was later on uncovered by the archaeological survey of India which revealed a fantastic world of religion, spirituality, art, and architecture underneath. The stepwell is unique in the sense of architecture that it is made in the shape of an inverted temple with over 500 sculptures and thousands of medium and small sculptures. This underrated place has to be one of the finest examples of Indian architecture at its best.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Ramkund Stepwell (Bhuj)</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7029" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ramkund-Stepwell.jpg" alt="Ramkund Stepwell" width="700" height="450" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ramkund-Stepwell.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ramkund-Stepwell-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ramkund-Stepwell-170x110.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Ramkund-Stepwell-370x238.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Unlike its contemporary stepwells, Ramkund falls under the more minimal and humbly decorated stepwells. It&#8217;s a lot simple, plain, and more straightforward. Currently, it holds algae water in its square tank which has a step surrounding it to lead the visitor up to the source. In the name of decoration, there are tiny miniature carved-out idols adorning the walls of the stepwell all over. These miniature idols are dedicated to Lord Vishnu and the idols represent the 10 different incarnations of the lord. Although not elaborately beautified by fine works of artistic design this vav is geometrically so perfect that it will leave you in awe. From the steps to the shape of the entire vav, it is truly a mark of what human engineering had achieved even during those ancient ages. Being located across from the Kutch Museum and Ram Dhun Temple it is an extremely rewarding experience that should be done at least once.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What comes to your mind when somebody mentions Gujarat? Statue of Unity, Dandiya, all India Chardham portals of Dwarkadheesh, colourful traditional clothes, Delectable authentic Gujarati cuisines, great ran of Kutch and many more but there is so much more to this historic and the westernmost state of India that one visit will not be enough. With a plethora of tourist attractions and a thriving biodiversity this fascinating land holds a lot of charm which has always attracted tourists and traders from far and wide ever since the early ages. The mosaic of cultures, traditions and beliefs is clearly represented through their ethnic beauty and general way of life. From beaches and national parks to temples and historical sites Gujarat is dotted with so many unique and interesting places that you will get tired of visiting but you will never run out of places to visit.</p>
<p>If you are planning a visit to Gujarat but don’t know where to visit then here are a few famous tourist attractions in Gujarat which you should not miss out on exploring:</p>
<h2><strong>Gujarat Historical Places:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Great Rann of Kutch</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6459" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Great-Rann-of-Kutch.jpg" alt="Great Rann of Kutch" width="700" height="466" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Great-Rann-of-Kutch.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Great-Rann-of-Kutch-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Great-Rann-of-Kutch-165x110.jpg 165w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Great-Rann-of-Kutch-370x246.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Inhabited by the Kutchi people of Gujarat and probably one of the most unique places in India, this sprawling white salt marsh of Thar Desert is one of the most incredible experiences for anyone looking to have an offbeat travel experience. You can go on a mesmerising jeep safari of Rann or visit it during the celebration of Rann Utsav. During the monsoon season this entire region gets completely submerged under water and is not the right to visit. Winter is another interesting time when you can spot flamingos here who reach here from Siberia.</p>
<h3><strong>Champaner &#8211; Pavagadh Archaeological Park</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6465" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pavagadh-Archaeological-Park.jpg" alt="Pavagadh Archaeological Park" width="700" height="487" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pavagadh-Archaeological-Park.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pavagadh-Archaeological-Park-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pavagadh-Archaeological-Park-158x110.jpg 158w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pavagadh-Archaeological-Park-359x250.jpg 359w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Located in the district of Panchmahal this UNESCO world heritage site is situated all around the historial and ancient city of Champaner. Built by sultan Mahmud Begada the entire site is adorned with various forts, Stepwells, tanks, temples, sites dating back to the chalcolithic age and so much more. A visit here will open your minds to a whole new world. The park is especially popular for its various Hindu and Muslim architecture dating back to 15th and 16th century. Walking here you will feel like you have walked into a time machine.</p>
<h3><strong>Lalgarh Palace And Museum</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6460" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lalgarh-Palace-And-Museum.jpg" alt="Lalgarh Palace And Museum" width="700" height="456" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lalgarh-Palace-And-Museum.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lalgarh-Palace-And-Museum-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lalgarh-Palace-And-Museum-170x110.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Lalgarh-Palace-And-Museum-370x241.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Built during the months of 1902 and 1926 this iconic and magnificently grand palace structure was constructed for sir Ganga Singh Maharaja of Bikaner. Currently parts of its are functioning as a luxurious heritage hotel there are several grand elements that makes this palace extremely royal.

Over a period of several decades numerous canals and tunnel systems were developed to bring in the water from the 3 river systems and recharge the aquifer. This has helped in fulfilling Bhuj’s water related needs. The entire lake pans out over an area of about 28 acres and also consists of a mid-lake garden just like in the case of the Kankaria Lake in Ahmedabad. This central lake garden is known as Rajendra Park and is maintained as a very beautiful garden. The best part? People can go there for a swim and relax.

If you wish to explore Dwarka and its spiritual gravity, here are the top 5 places of Dwarka that might interest you. So read on…</p>
<p>Dwarka, a city in the state of Gujarat is a quintessential place of visit for the Hindus. The city bears the remains of a time when Lord Krishna, himself stayed on this land and turned it into a holy place for ages to come. It is an essential place from the context of pilgrimage and has several places which are considered immensely important. Below are enlisted a total of five places to visit in Dwarka.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Bet Dwarka</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1650" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Bet-Dwarka.jpg" alt="Bet Dwarka" width="700" height="367" /><br />
The place is alternatively known as Bet Shankhodar and has immense historical, cultural, and mythological importance. Apart from being a presidential palace for Lord Krishna and his queens, the place has also served as a port for years, until the development of Okha. From Okha, one can commute via ferry to Bet Dwarka. The temple is laden with evidences from the yesteryears. There are numerous temples and shrines that speak of a glorious past. The key attraction on the island is the Dwarkadhish Temple. This is not all about the magnificence of the place. It also has the Jain Temples where the Tirthankaras are worshiped. The Vaishnavas also hold the place as a place of utmost importance as it has the seat of the Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Apart from being a place of pilgrimage, it attracts millions with the availability of water sports and excursions opportunities to the visitors. There is also an active marine life that calls for visitors.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Dwarkadheesh Temple</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6456" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Dwarkadhish-Temple.jpg" alt="Dwarkadhish Temple" width="700" height="440" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Dwarkadhish-Temple.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Dwarkadhish-Temple-300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Dwarkadhish-Temple-170x107.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Dwarkadhish-Temple-370x233.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
It is considered amongst the four major Hindu pilgrimages. The literal translation of the word Dwarkadheesh is, Lord Krishna himself, who ruled over this pious city. The temple is also known by the name of Jagat temple. The structure is decorated with many idols, the main being that of Lord Vishnu. Each day, elaborate worship activities are conducted which also includes bathing and decking up the idol of Lord Krishna. Janmashtami is observed with much pomp and show, thus marking it as the most vital of all festivals here in Dwarkadheesh. According to legends, the holy city of Dwarka was built by Lord Krishna himself at a time which approximately dated back to 5000 years. The city stood on the banks of the river Gomati. The city stood strong and high for almost a century, till the Lord reigned over the place, and when the Lord set his journey onwards for his heavenly abode, the city submerged under the sea.</p>

<h3><strong>3. Nageshwar Jyotirlinga Temple</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1652" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Nageshwar-Jyotirlinga-Temple.jpg" alt="Nageshwar Jyotirlinga Temple" width="700" height="368" /><br />
This temple is fondly worshiped as one of the key places of Hindu pilgrimage. The jyotirlinga situated in the temple of Nagnath is worshiped as the Nageshwar Jyotirlinga Temple. This is one of the 12 Jyotirlinga shrines that exist. The temple is located in Saurashtra, on the way between Dwarka city and Bet Dwarka. Lord Krishna worshiped the Jyotirlinga. The linga is positioned such that it faces south, and the Gomukh facing east. Namdev, a devotee of the Lord used to sing bhajans in praise of the Lord. The other priests yelled at him and asked him to spare the sides from which the Lord was visible. He then asked the priests to suggest him a suitable side so that the view of the Lord would not be obstructed. The priests then carried him to the south side. Quite amazingly, the linga was found to be facing the south. The shape and texture of the stone of this linga is also quite astonishing and resembles a Rudraksha.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Rukmini Mandir</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1654" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Rukmini-Temple.jpg" alt="Rukmini Temple" width="700" height="397" /><br />
This temple is situated on the banks of the Bhagirathi River. <a href="https://www.gujaratexpert.com/dwarka-tours-packages/">Dwarka Pilgrimage Tour</a> is considered incomplete without a visit to this holy site. The idol is of excellent beauty, and there are four hands of the idol which hold varied items, significant to Hinduism. This four-handed idol symbolizes the reincarnation of Goddess Lakshmi. Rukmini eloped with Lord Krishna in order to marry him. There were none in her family to support her alliance with the Lord. Hence the duo chose the extreme step. However, a great battle ensued between her elder brother and the Lord, in which the Lord was victorious. To celebrate the marriage and victory in the battle, a feast was organized wherein Saint Durvasa was invited. The saint agreed on the condition that Krishna and Rukmini would pull the chariot which would carry the saint, instead of horses or bulls. As the pair pulled the chariot, thirst overpowered Rukmini and thus the Lord hit the ground, such that Bhagirathi River appeared to quench the Queen’s thirst. This angered the saint for he felt insulted as he was not offered to drink first from the river water. He cursed that the land of Dwarka would never have sweet water and Lord Krishna and his Queen Rukmini would be estranged. Thus the Rukmini Temple stands afar from the Dwarkadheesh Temple.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Gomti Ghat</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1656" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gomti-Ghat-e1438329031631.jpg" alt="Gomti Ghat" width="700" height="302" /><br />
Gomti River is one of the sacred Hindu rivers. It is a tributary of the Ganges and originates in the Himalayas. The ghat can be reached from the Swarg Dwar area of the Dwarkadheesh Temple. The river meets the sea and the place is revered as a sacred place. To have a holy bath in the water is considered pivotal for the pilgrims. These are the top five places to visit in the holy land of Dwarka.</p>
