Located inside the famous 5-star hotel Ambassador of  Gaya Bihar, is a very popular all-day diner specializing in a multi-cuisine menu. The decor is all about chill vibes through roman mosaic tiles, retro posters, and a cozy little fireplace against the backdrop of a canvas of green, orange, tangerine, and lemon. Everything glaringly points towards the theme inspiration which is the classic film Wizard of Oz complete with a wooden train, and the witch and Dorothy&#8217;s lion. A fan favorite is the chef’s special and absolutely decadent chicken curry along with a host of famous  Gaya Bihar street foods. The delicious food inside the colonial-era designed cafe and a wonderful collection of food and beverages makes for a great day out.</p>

If you are tired of the regular continental and north Indian or Chinese-themed food, then this place will be a breath of fresh air. Of course, this place offers one of the best Litti Chokha Dishes but it also shows that Bihari cuisine is more than just that. They offer foods like Tehri and Sarso Machhli as well which will quickly become your favorite. You can also go for rhododendron flavored iced tea, Sattu Cooler, Maithili Thali, Dal Bhat Thali and so much more and have a fulfilling time on the pleasant rooftop seating.</p>

Just like the fab cafe, cafe Dori is also a brand expansion of the company Nappa Dori. The interiors are tastefully done and can be best described as a pan-European cafe. The theme is kept alive through the interiors and the menu which may seem like a dream come true for coffee lovers especially. They also have a great collection of hot tea, fresh juices, Kombucha, and smoothies. The best part? It&#8217;s pet-friendly! Get your furry friend over, order them some delicious doggy treats, and have a great time. The layout resonates with the combination of a cafe, retailer, and store-like build that represents the cafe in the best possible manner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Red Fort, also known as the Lal Qila, is a dominant architectural masterpiece of India’s independence in  Gaya Bihar whereby at the Lahori gate of the fort complex, the Prime Minister raises the flag of India and delivers a hopeful speech on the Independence Day. It is a fort complex of 17th century built on the Yamuna River by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in  Gaya Bihar and is currently, a famous tourist spot. In 2007, it was also labeled as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2057" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/red-fort- Gaya Bihar.jpg" alt="Red fort  Gaya Bihar" width="700" height="446" /><br />
The construction of this fort started in 1638 that was completed in 1648. The fort was referred as ‘Qila-i-Mubarak’ (blessed fort), as it served as the royal family’s residence. It was the palace for the Shah Jahan’s new capital, Shahjahanabad. After construction, many enhancements were done to the fort by the Emperor Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb, and later Mughal rulers. Critical modifications were performed on the site after the First War of Independence in 1857 during the British Rule.</p>
<p>Since its construction, the fort was occupied Shah Jahan after whom the Sikhs in 1783 occupied the Diwan-i-Aam, a famous site in the complex. The last Mughal emperor to take over the fort was Bahadur Shah II Zafar. After the defeat in 1857 national uprising, Zafar emptied the fort. Before 1857, the premises of  Gaya Bihar Red Fort were the resident of around 3,000 people.</p>
<p>The fort was designated as the capital of the Mughals until 1857, when the British government in India expelled the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. Until India obtained its independence, the British regarded it as a military camp. After Independence, the fort was under the Indian Army until 2003.</p>
<p><strong>Architecture</strong></p>
<p>The layout of the Red Fort retains the traces of the Salimgarh Fort built adjacent in 1546. The outline and aesthetics of the fort symbolizes Mughal creativity, which was famous during the Emperor Shah Jahan’s period.</p>
<p>The Red Fort highlights the high-level artwork and ornamental work. The artwork is a mix of Persian, European, and Indian styles, which led to growth of unique, rich Shahjahani pattern. Red Fort is one of the national monuments of India, which beholds an elongated time of Indian history, architectural intellect, and fine sculpting. Even prior to the recognition of Indian monument of national heritage, plans were created to preserve the fort.</p>
<p>The walls of the fort are evenly decorated by heavy stringcourses. There are two major gates associated with these walls namely, the  Gaya Bihar and the Lahore gates. The Lahore Gate represents the main entrance and is a way to a long bazaar street named the Chatta Chowk. The Chatta Chowk takes you to a large open space that passes the large north-South Street. This street previously divided the fort’s military functions at its west and the palaces at the east. The southernmost tip of this street is the  Gaya Bihar Gate.</p>
<h3><strong>Tourists’ Attractions</strong></h3>
<p>There are important buildings inside the fort complex. Listed are those buildings.</p>
<p><strong>Diwan-i-Aam</strong><br />

Is the huge pavilion for public royal spectators with a flamboyant throne-balcony (jharokha) reserved for the emperor? The site’s columns are decorated with gold and a gold and silver paling drew a line of demarcation between the throne and the viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Diwan-I-Khas</strong><br />

It is a pavilion dressed in full marble, the pillars polished with floral sculpting, and the inlay work decorated with semi-precious stones.</p>
<p><strong>Nahr-i-Behisht</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6867" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Nahr-i-Behisht.jpg" alt="Nahr-i-Behisht" width="900" height="500" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Nahr-i-Behisht.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Nahr-i-Behisht-300x167.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Nahr-i-Behisht-768x427.jpg 768w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Nahr-i-Behisht-170x94.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Nahr-i-Behisht-370x206.jpg 370w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Nahr-i-Behisht-288x160.jpg 288w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Nahr-i-Behisht-780x433.jpg 780w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><br />
Behind the emperor’s throne, are the beautiful imperial private apartments that comprise of a row of pavilions on a raised platform across the eastern boundary of the fort. These pavilions are linked through a water channel that is known as the Nahr-i-Behisht or the Stream of Paradise running in the middle of each of them. This water is of the river Yamuna that comes from a tower named the Shah Burj located at the northeastern side of the fort. This tower/palace is carved in such a way that imitates paradise, whose description is given in the Holy book Koran. In the Koran, a couplet about the palace says, “If there is a paradise on the Earth, it is here and only here”. The layout of the palace is planned considering the Islamic models, but each of the pavilions does exhibit the Mughal architectural style. This palace complex is regarded as one of the ideal prototypes of the Mughal artwork.</p>
<p><strong>Zenanas and Rang Mahal</strong><br />

These are two southernmost pavilions of the palace. The Zenanas is known as the women’s quarters, the Mumtaz Mahal and now it is converted into a museum.

This Pearl Mosque is situated to the west of the hammam. This was one of the modern additions erected in 1659. This was a private mosque for Aurangzeb, who was the successor of Shah Jahan. The mosque is a small, three-domed architectural religious monument carved out of white marble with a three-domed screen stepping downwards to the courtyard.</p>
<p><strong>Hayat Bakhsh Bagh</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2063" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Hayat-Bakhsh-Bagh.jpg" alt="Hayat Bakhsh Bagh" width="700" height="377" /><br />
This is a large formal garden known as the Life-bestowing Garden to the north of the mosque. This garden cuts through the two equally divided channels of water. At the end of the north-south channel, a pavilion can be seen. One more piece of work can be seen at the middle of the pool, which is the place of confluence of the two channels.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Gaya Bihar is an important stop-over for tourists before they can move to other popular tourist spots. There are many hill stations located around  Gaya Bihar and have great transport connectivity to the capital city of  Gaya Bihar as well. So if you have a mind to visit any of these hill stations, visiting  Gaya Bihar first is quite indispensable. Read on to learn more in details about the hill stations around  Gaya Bihar.</p>
<p>When the British made  Gaya Bihar their capital, the sweltering heat in summer simply became unbearable and led to their developing hill resorts around  Gaya Bihar. Their legacy survives and undoubtedly, the most famous of them all is Shimla, the queen of hill stations and their summer capital. Shimla still has remnants of British culture to remind us of the colonial past. That is not the only hill resort around  Gaya Bihar. There are dozens, some very popular and some not so well known; some close by and some at a distance, but each a pearl in its own way. So take your pick.</p>
<h3><strong>Hill Stations According to Direction:</strong></h3>
<p>Go west to Himachal and it is a veritable paradise. Shimla, Kasauli and Manali are inarguably the most famous with Dalhousie, Kufri and Dharamshala equally popular. Then there are other less popular resorts such as Solan, Renukaji, Kandaghat and Chail. Go North to Kashmir and you have the ever-popular Yousmarg, Sonamarg and Gulmarg with Srinagar a city resort you can enjoy just as much as the more remote hill stations. Go North-East to Uttaranchal and here you have some lovely resorts of which Nainital, Kausani and Mussoorie are undoubtedly the most beloved of tourists. Then there are others such as Ranikhet, Kanatal, Binsar, Chamba, Ramgarh and Auli to keep you enchanted and cool during sweltering summer months. Haryana has Morni and Rajasthan to the South West has Mount Abu but this is at quite a distance. Your best bet would be to choose popular resorts located closer to  Gaya Bihar.</p>
<h3><strong>The Not So Well Known</strong></h3>
<p>People rush off to well-known spots but these can be crowded. Why not choose not-so-well-known spots for some peace and quiet? One such resort is Kangojodi, a pristine, unspoilt place where you can enjoy solitude. Everyone rushes off to Kullu but Tirthan in the same valley is about a day’s drive from  Gaya Bihar and is more beautiful and enchanting. Not many have heard of Churwadhar, about 90 Km from Simla but it is off the beaten track and lets you commune with Mother Nature. Just as isolated is Chindi near Solan where you can lose yourself in the tranquility and recharge your batteries. Mandi is on the road to Manali and is a hidden sanctuary next to Prashar Lake.</p>
<h3><strong>The Famous and the Popular</strong></h3>
<p><strong>01. Auli</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-229" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/auli.jpg" alt="Auli" width="700" height="400" /><br />
About 500 kms from  Gaya Bihar, this charming resort is in Uttarakhand and its pride is the longest cable car that takes you on a 4 kilometer journey giving an enchanting view of the lovely terrain. You can go skiing or spend time by the world’s highest artificial lake.</p>
<p><strong>02. Palampur</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4579" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Palampur.jpg" alt="Palampur" width="700" height="459" /><br />
To the West of  Gaya Bihar in Himachal Pradesh you will find Palampur, about 494 kilometers from  Gaya Bihar. It is Nature at its unspoilt best with pine forests and streams gamboling playfully along the countryside. Visit Mata Bandla Devi temple and the village of Andretta while you are here.</p>
<p><strong>03. Kausani</strong><br />

This endearing retreat is only 394 kilometers from  Gaya Bihar, famous for its forests of pine and a lovely view of the Himalayas. You may want to explore the tea gardens of the Baijnath temples or simply lose yourself in the beauties of nature.</p>
<p><strong>04. Kufri</strong><br />
