										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Say coffee and one thinks about Italian and Parisian cafes and American coffee chains. But not many know that coffee would not have reached Europe or the Americas if it were not for the Middle East.it was discovered in the 13<sup>th</sup> century and later on its use spread to Egypt and Yemen and had reached to the rest of the Middle East, Persia, Turkey, and northern Africa by the 16th century. From there it spread to Europe and to the Americas. In fact the word coffee is etymologically born from the Arabic qahwa.</p>
<p>Coffee plays an important role in the Arabic culture. In the UAE and in Dubai, visitors will often be offered coffee, as well as tea when attending a business meeting or visiting someone at home. It is considered rude to decline coffee as offering it is a symbol of hospitality. Traditionally the coffee is poured from a brass pot with a long spout called the dallah into a small cup called the finyal.</p>
<p>If in a traditional Arabic Coffee Shop one must keep the following points in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you give the cup back to the server without shaking it, they will pour you another cup of qahawa.</li>
<li>The right hand is used for drinking, eating and even offering food or drinks.</li>
<li>You may need to be specific. Just saying coffee means you will be offered Arabic coffee. If you say Nescafe, American coffee will be served to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most places serve dates and a glass of water along with the not filtered or percolated but boiled) and served with a spice, usually cardamom. It is never served with milk. Arabic coffee is however different from Turkish coffee which is thicker and stronger.</p>
<p>In most Arabic joints, tea is offered black and with sugar. It is called the Sulemani and usually the tea bag is left in the cup so that one can make it as strong as one wishes. One can also ask for the mint tea &#8211; basically a Sulemani served with mint leaf &#8211; which is truly refreshing</p>
<h3><strong>1. Basta Art Café</strong></h3>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4389" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Basta-Art-Café.jpg" alt="Basta Art Café" width="700" height="429" /><br />

<p>Walking through the Bastakiya and enjoying the architecture and art is thirsty work, which is why one is extremely thankful for the Basta Art Café. Not only does it serve good food, it also feeds the senses. Its main seating area is outside in a courtyard under the shade of a huge tree away from the din of the busy alleys outside. During summer one can sit indoors with its artistic collection of knick-knacks.

<p>You may wonder why anyone would want to spend time painting pre-prepared ceramic goodies while having coffee. But until you have tried the two together or tried enjoying a cup while travelling with little kids you will not understand how ingenious and soul-satisfying the idea is. The ceramic items may range from bowls, coasters, cups, animals and mini Burj Al Arabs or Burj Khalifa of varying sizes. It is a great place to keep the kids occupied while enjoying a coffee and dish from the extensive menu, offering everything from sandwiches and bagels to crepes and steak. Just make sure that if you are doing this you give the cafe team at least a few days to glaze your work and return it to you. If you are in a bit of hurry then there is always the option of taking the unglazed work with you and getting the glaze done when you get back home.</p>

The food is satisfying, but the highlight has to be the much advertised hot chocolate shots &#8211; a mini tea cup full of a thick drink with chunks of chocolate floating in it &#8211; rich, delicious and quite filling. And as far as coffee goes one is spoilt for choice, but definitely tries the strong Ethiopian blend.</p>
<h3><strong>10. MORE Cafe</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4395" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/MORE-Cafe.jpg" alt="MORE Cafe" width="700" height="435" /><br />

But MORE is more than just the sum of its coffee. Its menu lists some fine dishes. The chef sticks to the basics and does it well, be it the eggs Benedict or the salads and sandwiches. MORE is also good for a proper sit down lunch or dinner with delicious steaks and pastas on its list. The amount is quite generous which can easily be shared between two.</p>
<h3><strong>11. Circle</strong></h3>
<p>Beach Park Plaza Centre and Dubai Media City<br />
Phone +971 4 342 8177</p>
<p>If you love your bagel then head to the aptly named Circle. It is home to the American staple H&amp;H Bagels in flavors like cinnamon, onion, sesame seed and poppy seed.

Its classic smoked salmon, cream cheese and capers are a hit while its unusual lamb burger (meat on top of a bagel) it is delicious. Circle’s Smoothies and desserts are worth a second visit.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dubai Like No Other</strong></p>
<p>World-class building architectures. Open City in a Muslim Country. Business Hub. Luxurious villas and cars. Great electronic and Fashion finds and so much more is what attracts lots of people from around the world to visit Dubai, one of seven of the United Arab Emirates. A city that never sleeps and is actually more alive in night rather than in daytime. A city that develops continuously and give the world spectacular man-made wonders that can put anyone in awe.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Beach-Resorts-in-Dubai.jpg" alt="Beach-Resorts-in-Dubai" width="700" height="401" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5028" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Beach-Resorts-in-Dubai.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Beach-Resorts-in-Dubai-300x172.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Beach-Resorts-in-Dubai-170x97.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Beach-Resorts-in-Dubai-370x212.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><strong>But Is This The Life For You?</strong></p>
<p>Be sure to know all about it before you take the big leap that may change you and the lives surrounding you. May this be a helpful guide for those who want to live the Emirati (UAE local) life.</p>
<p><strong>Finding The Right Job</strong></p>
<p>Dubai is considered a business hub offering various working opportunities for professionals and non-professionals alike. In a country where experience and expertise is being valued more than scholastic degrees, it takes time, patience and perseverance to hit the job you&#8217;ve been wanting.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a huge percentage of professionals accepting a job that either pays a little than what they deserve or placed in a role they don&#8217;t want to become.</p>
<p>Chances are, you won&#8217;t be happy and end up grumbling all throughout. But this is not the case all the time. There are others who have fallen in this category once, and worked their way towards their dream job, after all, it pays to know other stuff in depth and the company always appreciates talent and multi-tasking.</p>
<p>So to avoid becoming a relenting employee, be sure of what you want in terms of role, position and even salary right before you face that interview.</p>
<p><strong>Finding The Right Accommodation</strong></p>
<p>Residences in Dubai varies in type and it all depends on your budget and style of living. Can you afford a 3 bedroom villa in a quiet community? How about a studio-type apartment in a high-rise building? Can you live with different people in one flat? Or you can&#8217;t stand sharing a room with another?</p>
<p>All these and more are the things you have to consider when scouting for a place to live. While finance will be a main thing in consideration, your comfort and safety should not fall behind. If you&#8217;re a new settler and have relatives or friends living in the city and they are willing to take you in their place, I would suggest you to go for it until you are fully ready to be on your own. If not, you can always ask for their recommendations as it could be very helpful before you hand down that 6 months or 1-year check rent payment to the agent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a new destination for you and it is best that you will feel happy and content living the life you deserve!</p>
<p><strong>Means of Transportation</strong></p>
<p>Like any well-developed country, Dubai offers a variety of means of public transport. The most popular among which are the double-deck buses, wherein the first deck will be occupied by women and males will be on the second deck. But if you want to avoid slow traffic especially during rush hours, then the Dubai metro is for you. It even has a cabin (Gold card required) that will give you a panoramic view of the city. Taxis are also available and there are the &#8220;Pink taxi&#8221; with lady chauffer&#8217;s to specifically cater to female passengers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, owning a private vehicle in Dubai through bank approval is as easy as 1-2-3. Aside from there is no tax payable, petroleum is at its best lowest prices. So if you&#8217;re planning to live an hour or so away from your workplace, then having a car is highly recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Cost of Living</strong></p>
<p>Name it, Dubai has it. From cheap quality finds to luxury items, all these are being offered to residents and tourists. There are man-made wonders existing around the emirate that attracts people to visit and spend. They even host the largest shopping malls and water parks that is tempting enough to enjoy leisurely.</p>
<p>Cost of living in this country is enormously high. But it always helps to be a little cautious with your purchases. Cash is not an issue as credit cards are widely used to sustain the spending need. Enjoy now, pay later is the common trend of living for most residents. Just be sure that the amount you spend can be covered by your payments periodically so as not to suffer being drowned in debts.</p>
<p><strong>Customs and Traditions</strong></p>
<p>Dubai is an open city. Non-Muslim females are not required to wear Abbaya (loose black clothing worn by Muslim females) and Hijab (cloth used to cover their hair). Fashion is widely embraced and anyone can wear all types of clothing provided it&#8217;s not offensive to other Muslims and is worn appropriately at all times (For example, females are not allowed to wear revealing clothes during the observation of Ramadan).</p>
<p>Females in this country are also allowed to drive, and they even are allowed to mingle with the opposite gender publicly, again of course, in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p>But in spite of all these, like any other Muslim countries, Dubai still highly values their traditions and beliefs. Being foreign in it, one should be able to show the maximum amount of respect, if not follow.</p>
<p><strong>Work with Pleasure</strong></p>
<p>I know you want to achieve stability and even your dream promotion at the shortest possible time, who doesn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>But more work does not necessarily mean more pay. It helps knowing how to socialize and give yourself a reward for job well done.</p>
<p>Try the open beaches along Jumeirah with spectacular views and where you will even find different communities bonding during weekends. You can join your peers or just sit back while you enjoy your favorite book. You can drive to Palm Jumeirah, visit Atlantis, or simply scout on the luxurious villas while dreaming that one day, you can have one too! Also, window shopping is not a crime and you can do so in Dubai Mall or Mall of the Emirates (two of the world&#8217;s largest shopping centers),</p>
<p>You are living in a beautiful city, so go out and explore! You don&#8217;t need to spend to appreciate the greatness that surrounds you. Work, yes. But don&#8217;t forget to enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>So, Is Dubai for you?</strong></p>
<p>Before making your decision, it always pays to be well-versed with your plans. Don&#8217;t hesitate to adjust it when you think you&#8217;re not ready. Proper research and advices from people who have been in UAE can be your best support in order to achieve, survive and sustain the demanding yet rewarding life that awaits you in this big city.</p>
<p>Always remember to follow your instincts, and don&#8217;t get lost along the way&#8211;stay true to your dreams.</p>

There are types of skiing you can do with either man-made snow or no snow at all. However, a lot of people see this as taking all of the fun out of it. Especially for the entire ski experience from the beginning preparations, all the way to the post skiing events. Events such as sitting in front of a fireplace with your friends with hot cups of cocoa are as much a part of this activity as skiing itself.<br />

Skiing is a sport that is rich in history, with its roots being traced all the way back to 600 BC in China. However, it is primarily associated with countries in Scandinavia such as Norway, Sweden and Finland. It was in the latter two countries mentioned that the use of asymmetrical skis originated. The idea of using two poles in this activity came about in the mid-1700s. In its early days it was used for transportation purposes rather than the widespread recreational use it now boasts.</p>
<p>It is highly possible that most people never associated the Middle Eastern countries with skiing. However, there are some wonderful skiing facilities there; especially in Dubai that are quite popular with native people and tourists alike. Most notably is the Ski Dubai recreational facility located in the Mall of Emirates. This is the first indoor ski center in the entire Middle East with skiing itself being just one of the many activities to enjoy. People can also go snowboarding there or take a ride on the Snow Bullet; OR simply play in the snow. While you are there, do not forget to “meet” their world-famous penguins. This facility also offers expert trainers in a wide variety of classes for people who do not already know how to ski (or for those who want to improve their skills.)</p>
<p>When you are taking a break from skiing there are special events to enjoy. One of these events is known as the Ice Warrior “test where you can pit your skills against the “toughest commando assault on snow.” You can compete by yourself or join others in a team setting. If you succeed in your challenge you can win a trip to Amsterdam. Even if you do not win the grand prize you can go home with very nice consolation prizes. Either way, you will love the excitement of this event. Find out more information on this (and other activities) on the Ski Dubai website.</p>
<p>There is a specific section of the Ski Dubai website that focuses solely on pricing. It includes everything you would want to know about that. You must arrange for a babysitter for children younger than 2 years old. Due to safety reasons, they are not allowed to be in this park at all. The pricing section is broken down into the different kinds of activities you can participate in, as well as the various age levels. The park even has special deals from time to time to put an exclamation point on the fun you can have. This place is not just a recreational activity &#8211; it is an experience to be had by everyone that books their reservations. Make sure you do not pass up the opportunity to go there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Popular for being the shopping destination of the world the glitzy and glamorous city of Dubai is home to some of the most iconic landmarks. There is a plethora of magnificent shopping malls, traditional spice souks among others. Apart from being a huge shopaholic magnet this place also offers you the opportunity to take a peek into the life and times of the people in the Middle East.</p>
<h2><strong>Dubai City &#8211; The Great City-State</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Beaches-in-Dubai.jpg" alt="Beaches-in-Dubai" width="700" height="428" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5026" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Beaches-in-Dubai.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Beaches-in-Dubai-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Beaches-in-Dubai-170x104.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Beaches-in-Dubai-370x226.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>You must have heard of Dubai? Yes, the same Dubai that has overtaken the rest of the world in development and progress.</p>
<p>In just the last few years, Dubai has gone from a pearl fishing trading dock to a global hub of tourism, real estate and financial services.</p>
<p>There are no signs of slowing down for this behemoth and progress is only to increase rapidly, faster than ever before.</p>
<p>In what seems like overnight, Dubai has made a name for it on the global landscape and has established its position on the map stronger than ever before.</p>
<p>Not enough can be said about the progress of this small Emirate. Words are simply not enough. Other nations are simply looking at the development of Dubai in awe hoping to be part of it in some shape or form.</p>
<h3><strong>So where is Dubai?</strong></h3>
<p>Dubai is located in the country of United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the Middle East region. It is the most populated Emirate and the second largest in land mass.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t be surprised if it soon becomes the largest. How is that possible? The Dubai government is running out of land so fast that they are starting to &#8220;create&#8221; land by building artificial islands on the water to extend the shoreline.</p>
<p>Dubai is a peninsula located on the shore of the Persian Gulf region UAE. It&#8217;s bordering Emirates are Abu Dhabi and Sharjah. It also borders the Sultanate of Oman &#8211; an independent nation-state.</p>
<p>Dubai is just about 52 feet above sea level and covers an area just over 4,000 square kilometers (or 1,500 square miles) &#8211; smaller than most states in the US. But like I said to expect this number to grow with time.</p>
<h3><strong>History of Dubai</strong></h3>
<p>Published documents indicate that Dubai existed at least 150 years prior to the formation of the UAE. Prior to that all Emirates were independent.</p>
<p>The earliest record of Dubai&#8217;s history dates to 1095 CE. After that time nothing has been found until the mention of Dubai in a 1587 discussion that mentions the Emirate as a popular place for pearl diving.</p>
<p>Dubai volunteered to come under British protection in its early stages to get support from the Brits to fend off early challenges from its neighbours. Since its independence, it has always been ruled by the royal family of Dubai.</p>
<p>The rulers come from the Al Maktoum Dynasty which can be traced back to 1833 when they first arrived to claim Dubai from Abu Dhabi (current day capital of UAE).</p>
<p>This is when Dubai became an independent Emirate and here started the rule of the Al Maktoums. The ruler of Dubai (as of 2008) is Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.</p>
<p>Under his regime, Dubai has transformed completely and has established itself at the forefront of modern-day development. Dubai has the most liberal, modern and forward moving Mindset of all Emirates as it has developed faster and farther than its counterparts.</p>
<h3><strong>Dubai Weather</strong></h3>
<p>Dubai weather is generally hot, just as you would expect in a desert environment. But there are some very good times to go during the year. Humidity levels can also get quite high due to its waterfront location.</p>
<p>The best time to go to Dubai is in the winter months, precisely between November and mid-March. These are typically the best months to be in Dubai whether you want to enjoy the indoors or outdoors.</p>
<p>See a 12 month Dubai weather progression chart here. The chart includes average temperatures, sunshine and rainfall levels throughout the year.</p>
<h4><strong>Dubai Culture</strong></h4>
<p>However quite a bit has changed since. Dubai is clearly a mixing bowl and its culture is also quite diverse. Local Nationals (citizens) make up less than 20% of the population I believe. The rest are all immigrants.</p>
<p>One can argue that Dubai has lost its own identity because of the large immigrant population that significantly outnumber the local Nationals.</p>
<p>However, one can also argue that because of the immigration, Dubai has found and established a whole new cultural identity unique to Dubai.</p>
<h4><strong>Dubai Currency</strong></h4>
<p>Dubai adapted the Arab Emirate Dirham after it joined the formation of the UAE. The Dirham can also be written as Dh. Dhs. or AED. You will see the symbol either before or after the currency amount.</p>
<p>The dirham has been pegged to the US Dollar at Dh. 3.67 per $1. It is divided into 100 fils, which is the equivalent of cents.</p>
<h4><strong>Dubai Economy</strong></h4>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, oil is not the reason for Dubai&#8217;s economic boom.</p>
<p>Dubai has less than 2% of the world&#8217;s oil supply and is less than 6% of its total economy (GDP). Currently, Dubai is at the forefront of tourism, real estate and financial services. Soon it will be at the forefront of everything and some more. Wait till you see where Dubai is heading&#8230;</p>
<h4><strong>Dubai Visa</strong></h4>
<p>Visa laws are interesting in Dubai. They change on the fly depending on what the government wants to do that day (sometimes it probably depends on the Sheik&#8217;s mood).</p>
<p>If you are not a National (citizen) you will need a visa to <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/dubai-tour-packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>visit Dubai</strong></a> or anywhere else in the UAE. The only restriction in Dubai is that they don&#8217;t allow citizens of Israel to enter the country. This is a whole different topic for another day.</p>
<p>Dubai visas are easy to obtain. Citizens from many countries can get visa upon arrival with no problems at all. Some countries&#8217; citizens require visa in advance prior to arriving in Dubai.</p>
<h5><strong>Dubai&#8217;s Dilemma(s)</strong></h5>
<p>Dubai sounds like a fairy tale doesn&#8217;t it? Well like most fairy tales there is a witch in this story as well.</p>
<p>Dubai has its share of problems. Quite a bit in fact. It&#8217;s just that everything is on the up and up that people often don&#8217;t talk about the cons facing Dubai. Some choose to completely ignore them.</p>
<p>Some of Dubai&#8217;s main struggles (among many others) include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Government suppression that leads to no free speech in media or journalism.</li>
<li>Racism and favoritism toward local Nationals (try getting in a car accident with a local).</li>
<li>Lost cultural identity &#8211; Dubai doesn&#8217;t know what it wants. How can the government ban certain TV channels and websites when you can go out and get as many prostitutes you want down the road? This is just a small example of a much bigger issue.</li>
<li>Growing debt &#8211; Yes we don&#8217;t see it or talk about it, but Dubai is becoming a heavy debtor much like the United States.</li>
<li>Labor issues &#8211; human rights violations, poor working conditions for laborers and massive exploitation. The government is working to make this much better but time will tell how much progress we see here.</li>
<li>No regard for nature and environmental deterioration &#8211; all the biggest and best structures, dumping sand in water to create man-made islands, the biggest indoor ski resort in the middle of the desert are all fantastic achievements. But are they deteriorating our environment? There are many arguments both ways on this topic.</li>
</ul>
