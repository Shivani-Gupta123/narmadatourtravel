										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It had been a fantasy of mine since I was 10 years of age when I saw the shaded molded moving in the sky. I was constantly enthralled by riding in a hot air balloon high over some lovely nation. At that point, I thought what I&#8217;m sitting tight for? I have the opportunity to experience Hot Air Balloon ride in <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/sri-lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sri Lanka</a> in Dambulla, Sri Lanka!</p>
<p>Frequently when individuals <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/srilanka-tour-packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit Sri Lanka</a>, their lone goal is <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/exploring-colombo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colombo</a>. In any case, Sri Lanka isn&#8217;t finished without going to Dambulla. In the same way as other others, I had not known about Dambulla until the point when I came to explore Sri Lanka. This past January, my friend and I wandered on a very late excursion to Dambulla for our vacation. When I ventured off the transport I was interested in the view. I thought to myself, &#8220;This will be invigorating!&#8221; Little did I know, Dambulla would become the place where I overcame the fears holding me back and discovered a new sense of freedom in finding my true self.</p>

<p>Most visitors wander here for the correct motivation behind hot air swelling, and that was my central goal as well. The morning began with a 5 am pick up from my inn, welcomed in the transport by the quieted and energized prattle of kindred inflatable riders effectively gathered. Landing at Universal Balloon HQ in obscurity, we were offered espresso and a breakfast spread while we sat tight for the breeze to drop to a sheltered level. The orderlies cautioned us there might be no flights that day â€“ it&#8217;s constantly eccentric.</p>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Dambulla Hot Air Balloon Ride-The Anticipation</strong></h3>
<p>We woke the following morning to a stunning conventional Sri Lankan breakfast anticipating us. The most well-known dish in Dambulla is Beetroot Curry. The stew-like fixings are put into a pot in the broiler and heated for 2-3 hours. It&#8217;s conveyed to the table, aired out directly before you, and the final products are scrumptious. After breakfast, we continued to go on our Dambulla hot air expand ride.</p>
<p>After landing at our takeoff site, I was totally astonished seeing inflatables exploded and let go directly before me! At 6:30 AM, my eyes were opened to the beguiling locales of Dambulla hot air inflatables and the mystical, pixie-like stacks jabbing out into the horizon. My interest was started quickly. Like a tyke entering Walt Disney World out of the blue, I energetically rushed to get nearby of how the pilots were lighting the hot air inflatables. Before my Dambulla hot air balloon ride, I took a couple of previews of them. Seeing 35+ balloons float off at the same time into the sky appeared as though I had ventured into a fantasyland and a tall tale was anticipating me.</p>
<p>Much the same as Ariel in the Little Mermaid, I appreciate enterprises and was resolved to defeat any deterrents I may confront. It was astounding then that it took us this long to ride in a hot air balloon out of the blue. In any case, it was certainly justified regardless of the pause, particularly since we picked a standout amongst the most otherworldly places on the planet to influence this fantasy of our own come to genuine: Dambulla, Sri Lanka.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9620" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla-Sri-Lanka.jpg" alt="Hot Air Balloon Ride In Dambulla, Sri Lanka" width="900" height="575" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla-Sri-Lanka.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla-Sri-Lanka-300x192.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla-Sri-Lanka-768x491.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>A substantial Mercedes carry bus (tasteful, I know!) showed up outside our inn entryway at 6 a.m. on the dab, as guaranteed. We drove through the tight, twisting avenues of Dambulla, getting different visitors who looked an indistinguishable blend of languid and euphoric from we felt. We sat tight a bit for the pilots to check the climate. It was a decent sign that they weren&#8217;t going to fly with awful conditions, however, I was noiselessly crossing my fingers that they&#8217;d get the permission to fly. Furthermore, fortunate for us, they did! So we jumped on the bus indeed, this time went to the &#8220;platform&#8221;. (I don&#8217;t know whether that is the specialized term, however, it sounds cool!)</p>
<p>We truly didn&#8217;t comprehend what&#8217;s in store, as this was a first for the two of us. We went skydiving on our previous holiday, and bungee bouncing not long after. I thought about whether a hot air balloon ride would exhaust after those adrenaline-pumping high elevation exercises. Kid, was I off-base! Our pilot, moved the inflatable directly finished shake developments, up high and afterward down low once more. There were times I felt as though I could connect and touch the ground underneath, and others when my stomach completed a flip perceiving how high we&#8217;d risen. The ride was definitely not exhausting. The impression of drifting in an ocean of beautiful inflatables as the sun ascended in the sky was not at all like anything I&#8217;ve ever experienced before. I saw part of the way through the flight that my cheeks hurt from grinning the whole time, however, even that didn&#8217;t wipe the smile off my face.</p>

<h3><strong>Back On Strong Ground</strong></h3>
<p>We extremely comprehended what a specialist pilot is a point at which he handled the crate impeccably on a trailer stage behind a truck. How on the planet did he do that?! The arrival still boggles my brain. After everybody was on the strong ground, our pilot popped a few jugs of champagne and we had a celebratory toast while spouting about how astounding the previous hour had been. Everybody was all grins. How might you not be after a morning like we&#8217;d quite recently experienced?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are Traveling to Sri Lanka you have to take into account, some of the basic tips to make your visit a complete. Best time to visit this glorious country is between the months of December to March.</p>
<p>Once you are in the country to make a visit to an Ayurvedic spa using herbal plants to treat illness. Even if you&#8217;re not sick, you can still take pleasure from oil massage or a steam bath at one of the many Ayurvedic centers on the island.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3618" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Sri-Lanka-Travel-Tips.jpg" alt="Sri Lanka Travel Tips" width="741" height="486" /><br />
When come to purchasing precious stones- reputable gem centers in Colombo are the only trusty shops to value stones. Avoid buying any kind of precious gems (as they say) from the street vendors offering a tempting bargain, mostly they are worthless. Also avoid acquiring goods made of ivory, turtle shell, or reptile skin of any kind, for these are unlawful and such acquisition will be impounded by customs on your return home.</p>
<p>Decency is greatly honored by all segments of society. At beach recourse, beachwear is permissible, but less acceptable outside the beach and absolutely inadmissible at temples, mosques and churches. Nude and topless sunbathing is unlawful in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Remove footgear before entering Buddhist or Hindu shrines. Photographing and posing besides these religious sites is strictly prohibited. Also don&#8217;t take photos of military installations, bridges, airports or other crucial places. Even some religious edifices have covered gun installing and military bunkers.</p>
<p>It is very essential to get aware of how you are going to use the currency of the country you are visiting. The Sri Lankan rupee is divided into 100 cents. Coins are classified in the category of 5, 10, 25 and 50 cents and 1, 2, 5 and 10 rupees. Notes are labeled in values of 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000. While changing money, tourists are advised to ask for smaller classification notes as hawkers, taxi and auto drivers are generally incapable to give change.</p>
<p>Take medical advice before touring. It is recommended to get immunization against Hepatitis A, Polio and Typhoid and always better to have a Malaria medication while visiting during the monsoons. Keep proper preventives to mitigate indications of diarrhea, as well as for dehydration. Also, take proper precautions against Sunburn and heat debility. It is advisable to drink plenty of water to decrease dehydration. Does not drink tap water anywhere in Sri Lanka unless you have boiled or sterilized it yourself, otherwise go for mineral water.</p>
<p>Carry an umbrella while you are out on a tour. Sri Lankans always carry along with them, constantly in sunny as well as raining days- the city is always submerged with one or the other. Do watch your step &#8211; Sri Lanka leads the world in death by snakebite per capita.</p>
<p>Be careful buying the Sri Lankan fast food, normally sold on the streets during lunchtime &#8211; the curried meat, fish or vegetable packets. They may not be hygienic, as they are not cleaned properly. At the same time just go for a cool, refreshing coconut water that can easily be accessible by the side of the road in nominal price. By cutting the top lid of the fruit the vendor gives you a safe and delicious tropical drink.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t expect to have a queue at a bank, post office or any other place. Sri Lankans doesn&#8217;t form lines, so don&#8217;t be humble about propelling ahead.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the above points and luxuriate in the beautiful island of Sri Lanka.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you looking for an experience in Sri Lanka which is one of a kind and different from the regular old ways of travelling? Do you want to truly experience the beauty and authenticity of this classy island nation? Then there is no better way than to drive your way through in Sri Lanka. This is the best way of going off-grid and exploring the place on your own during your visit to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>You should also expect lot of disorder while driving in Sri Lanka and also blaring vehicle horns that toot from every direction. Nightmarish slow-moving traffic jams during office and school opening and closing times in cities like Colombo, Kandy, Dehiwala and Katunayake Airport road is a certainty and very poor and narrow roads and streets in rural Sri Lanka is the norm!<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3593" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Driving-in-Sri-Lanka.jpg" alt="Driving in Sri Lanka" width="741" height="486" /><br />
Some foreigners and expats are known to tell others about their driving in Sri Lanka saying you can drive really slow on the fast lanes of Colombo like nowhere else in the world and at times park where ever they want and whenever you please, even next to a no parking sign! Sometimes you will encounter drivers on the roads who are audacious enough to reverse on to the main road! You are likely to encounter drives at night without lights or drive with 6 sets of headlamps and cyclist in Sri Lanka donâ€™t wear bicycle safety helmets. However you will find out if you go to Sri Lanka that motorcycle helmets are mandatory and very strictly enforced by the Police.</p>
<p>All these coupled with driving in very traffic-clogged, poor maintained and mostly narrow Sri Lankan roads and even highways can be a very enjoyable or adventurous at times for some but a nightmare for most if you donâ€™t know what about driving in this island country.</p>
<p>But before you take the wheel and try to rent or borrow a car or vehicle and drive in Sri Lanka you must have your driving license from your country of origin or an international driving license. Sri Lanka News Online is informed that Foreign driving license holding tourist and expatriates who wish to convert their license to a Sri Lankan driving license are advised to first contact the Deputy Commissioner of Motor Traffic Department in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Most road sign in Sri Lanka are international standard signs but itâ€™s best to get a road sign booklet and refresh your memory. In many parts of this beautiful island country the speed limit is 40kmph, 60kmph and 72 km/h per hour. (thatâ€™s right, donâ€™t expect to drive more than 72 km/h not 172km/h)!</p>
<p>The International Driving Permit (IDP) maybe your passport to driving overseas and is recognized worldwide including in Sri Lanka as a valuable document identifying motorists as legally-licensed drivers. However this IDP may prevent or be an inconvenience when renting a car or when driving in a foreign country like Sri Lanka where English is not commonly spoken and understood. So as mentioned above contact your tourist or foreign agency or ticketing agent and make these arrangements if you plan to do lot of driving in Sri Lanka. The authorities may require you to present one of several documents to obtain driving permit or license to take the wheel in Sri Lankan roads.</p>
