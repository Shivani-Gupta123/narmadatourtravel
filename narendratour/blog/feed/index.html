If you are on the spiritual path and want to learn everything about Kumbh Mela, then this post will help you with all the relevant information you need to make the most out of your experience.</p>
<h3><strong>Overview </strong></h3>
<p>Prayagraj is modern-day Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh and the most important pilgrimage center. This place is the most pious place where the holy Ganga, Saraswati, and Yamuna meet and become one. Certainly, this is why it makes Kumbh Mela to be held in this city the most auspicious and significant spiritual event. Millions of pilgrims gather in Prayagraj Kumbh Mela to take a dip in the holy water of the Triveni Sangam to cleanse their sins. This grand spiritual gathering takes place every 12 years in Prayagraj and a smaller version of it is called Ardh Kumbh Mela, which is organized every six years in the same location. This spiritual gathering showcases the cultural, spiritual, and religious diversity of India and lasts several weeks. This event is not just a spiritual festival but also a cultural feast for people across the globe.</p>

<h3><strong>History of Kumbh Mela </strong></h3>
<p>Before you embark on this spiritual journey, you must know what is the history behind it. The origin of Kumbh Mela is associated with the days when Devtas and the demons conjointly churn the ocean to get the nectar out of it and fight over it as described in the ancient <a href="https://www.pilgrimagetour.in/blog/hindu-texts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Hindu texts</a>. The story begins with Samudra Manthan (the churning of the ocean) when gods and demons churned the ocean to extract the nectar of immortality. When finally, the nectar is extracted, gods and demons start fighting over who will consume it first. During this celestial event, a few drops of Amrit or nectar fell at four places. These four places are Prayagraj, <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/haridwar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haridwar</a>, Ujjain, and Nashik and become the sacred sites where Kumbh Mela is organized. Over the centuries, Kumbh Mela continues to attract millions of pilgrims from across the world including monks, spiritual leaders, ascetics, and travelers.</p>
<h3><strong>Significance of Kumbh Mela </strong></h3>
<p>Prayagraj Kumbh Mela is a great spiritual gathering that holds immense significance for Hindus. The primary reason for attending this event is to perform a ritual of bathing in the sacred water of Triveni Sangam where three <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/longest-rivers-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holy rivers</a> meet and become one. This bathing ritual is believed to wash away the sins of the person, leading him to Moksha or salvation and liberating him from the cycle of life and death. Apart from the spiritual aspect, Kumbh Mela offers a platform to religious scholars, yogis, saints, and spiritual leaders to share wisdom and encourage people to seek spiritual enlightenment. It is also a perfect place for someone, who wants to learn more about spirituality, Hindu culture, and ancient Indian traditions.</p>
<h3><strong>Bathing Dates and Shahi Snan </strong></h3>
<p>Shahi Snan or royal bath is one of the most crucial aspects of Kumbh Mela. There are some auspicious bathing dates determined by astrological alignments and hold great significance for spirituality seekers. In 2025, Prayagraj Kumbh Mela is scheduled to commence on January 13, 2025, and will conclude on February 26, 2025. Here are the key bathing dates of Kumbh Mela:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It had been a fantasy of mine since I was 10 years of age when I saw the shaded molded moving in the sky. I was constantly enthralled by riding in a hot air balloon high over some lovely nation. At that point, I thought what I&#8217;m sitting tight for? I have the opportunity to experience Hot Air Balloon ride in <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/sri-lanka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sri Lanka</a> in Dambulla, Sri Lanka!</p>
<p>Frequently when individuals <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/srilanka-tour-packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit Sri Lanka</a>, their lone goal is <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/exploring-colombo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colombo</a>. In any case, Sri Lanka isn&#8217;t finished without going to Dambulla. In the same way as other others, I had not known about Dambulla until the point when I came to explore Sri Lanka. This past January, my friend and I wandered on a very late excursion to Dambulla for our vacation. When I ventured off the transport I was interested in the view. I thought to myself, &#8220;This will be invigorating!&#8221; Little did I know, Dambulla would become the place where I overcame the fears holding me back and discovered a new sense of freedom in finding my true self.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9621" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla.jpg" alt="Hot Air Balloon Ride In Dambulla" width="900" height="500" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla-300x167.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla-768x427.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Most visitors wander here for the correct motivation behind hot air swelling, and that was my central goal as well. The morning began with a 5 am pick up from my inn, welcomed in the transport by the quieted and energized prattle of kindred inflatable riders effectively gathered. Landing at Universal Balloon HQ in obscurity, we were offered espresso and a breakfast spread while we sat tight for the breeze to drop to a sheltered level. The orderlies cautioned us there might be no flights that day – it&#8217;s constantly eccentric.</p>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Dambulla Hot Air Balloon Ride-The Anticipation</strong></h3>
<p>We woke the following morning to a stunning conventional Sri Lankan breakfast anticipating us. The most well-known dish in Dambulla is Beetroot Curry. The stew-like fixings are put into a pot in the broiler and heated for 2-3 hours. It&#8217;s conveyed to the table, aired out directly before you, and the final products are scrumptious. After breakfast, we continued to go on our Dambulla hot air expand ride.</p>
<p>After landing at our takeoff site, I was totally astonished seeing inflatables exploded and let go directly before me! At 6:30 AM, my eyes were opened to the beguiling locales of Dambulla hot air inflatables and the mystical, pixie-like stacks jabbing out into the horizon. My interest was started quickly. Like a tyke entering Walt Disney World out of the blue, I energetically rushed to get nearby of how the pilots were lighting the hot air inflatables. Before my Dambulla hot air balloon ride, I took a couple of previews of them. Seeing 35+ balloons float off at the same time into the sky appeared as though I had ventured into a fantasyland and a tall tale was anticipating me.</p>
<p>Much the same as Ariel in the Little Mermaid, I appreciate enterprises and was resolved to defeat any deterrents I may confront. It was astounding then that it took us this long to ride in a hot air balloon out of the blue. In any case, it was certainly justified regardless of the pause, particularly since we picked a standout amongst the most otherworldly places on the planet to influence this fantasy of our own come to genuine: Dambulla, Sri Lanka.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9620" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla-Sri-Lanka.jpg" alt="Hot Air Balloon Ride In Dambulla, Sri Lanka" width="900" height="575" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla-Sri-Lanka.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla-Sri-Lanka-300x192.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride-In-Dambulla-Sri-Lanka-768x491.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>A substantial Mercedes carry bus (tasteful, I know!) showed up outside our inn entryway at 6 a.m. on the dab, as guaranteed. We drove through the tight, twisting avenues of Dambulla, getting different visitors who looked an indistinguishable blend of languid and euphoric from we felt. We sat tight a bit for the pilots to check the climate. It was a decent sign that they weren&#8217;t going to fly with awful conditions, however, I was noiselessly crossing my fingers that they&#8217;d get the permission to fly. Furthermore, fortunate for us, they did! So we jumped on the bus indeed, this time went to the &#8220;platform&#8221;. (I don&#8217;t know whether that is the specialized term, however, it sounds cool!)</p>
<p>We truly didn&#8217;t comprehend what&#8217;s in store, as this was a first for the two of us. We went skydiving on our previous holiday, and bungee bouncing not long after. I thought about whether a hot air balloon ride would exhaust after those adrenaline-pumping high elevation exercises. Kid, was I off-base! Our pilot, moved the inflatable directly finished shake developments, up high and afterward down low once more. There were times I felt as though I could connect and touch the ground underneath, and others when my stomach completed a flip perceiving how high we&#8217;d risen. The ride was definitely not exhausting. The impression of drifting in an ocean of beautiful inflatables as the sun ascended in the sky was not at all like anything I&#8217;ve ever experienced before. I saw part of the way through the flight that my cheeks hurt from grinning the whole time, however, even that didn&#8217;t wipe the smile off my face.</p>

<h3><strong>Back On Strong Ground</strong></h3>
<p>We extremely comprehended what a specialist pilot is a point at which he handled the crate impeccably on a trailer stage behind a truck. How on the planet did he do that?! The arrival still boggles my brain. After everybody was on the strong ground, our pilot popped a few jugs of champagne and we had a celebratory toast while spouting about how astounding the previous hour had been. Everybody was all grins. How might you not be after a morning like we&#8217;d quite recently experienced?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>God’s own country- that’s what <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/kerala">Kerala</a> has always been. Naturally, a land so pretty that it beckons even the heavens into its premises deserves a capital city that is no less charming and exquisite. And Trivandrum is the place that remains steeped in pride in being the capital of this really magnificent of all states in India. Thiruvananthapuram or Trivandrum is as exotic a <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/kerala-tourist-attractions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tourist destination as Kerala</a> itself, earning it the epithet of the Evergreen City of India.</p>
<p>Indeed, residing in the plethora of natural wonders as it does, Trivandrum is no lesser a haven than the state it ‘capitalises on’. But even as a prime tourist destination, Trivandrum still harbours places that remain rare, in that they are less known names and lesser explored destinations. Here’s a list of rare places to visit in Trivandrum so that you dare to venture on the road less taken on your next Kerala travel sojourn-</p>
<h3><strong>1- Shanghumukham Beach</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 8 km from Trivandrum city.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Free.</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open 24/7 (best during daylight).</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 15–20 min drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Sunset/sunrise, Sagarakanyaka sculpture, peaceful beach walks.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9591" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shanghumukham-Beach.jpg" alt="Shanghumukham Beach" width="900" height="551" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shanghumukham-Beach.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shanghumukham-Beach-300x184.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Shanghumukham-Beach-768x470.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>While the entire expanse of Kerala abounds in beaches that make for really famous tourist destinations, it’s indeed a surprise that a sandy expanse as definitive as the Shanghumukham beach in Trivandrum remains only a rare phenomenon when it comes to being one of the must visit places with the typical touristry appeal. In its white sands and exclusivity, the beach really is a splendid place to be in- one where you can remain unfazed by the bustle of life as well as the clamour of existence.</p>
<p>An exquisite shoreline, vistas of serenity, beholding sunrise views and impeccable sunset experiences, there is no wonder of nature that Shanghumukham beach does not delight its visitors with. A very striking presence in this picturesque, isolated beach is an exemplary mermaid- the Sagarakanyaka &#8211; sculpted by renowned Indian sculptor Kanayi Kunhiraman. Also an exclusive location of the Arattu festival, the spectacular beach is undoubtedly a prime presence in the capital region of Kerala.</p>
<h3><strong>2- Poovar</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 30 km south of Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Free (boat rides extra).</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 1-hour drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Boat rides, visit floating cottages, explore beaches.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9590" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Poovar-Backwaters.jpg" alt="Poovar Backwaters" width="900" height="511" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Poovar-Backwaters.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Poovar-Backwaters-300x170.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Poovar-Backwaters-768x436.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Poovar might be a tourist town in Trivandrum but it still remains among the rare places to visit given that it sits at a very southernmost point of the district. The magnificent beach that Poovar houses however is relatively well known. With its stunning natural beauty complemented perfectly by the pleasant weather, Poovar should make for a really ideal holiday detour. A pretty coastal village, more accurately an island, the view from Poovar encompasses the mighty Neyyar river confluencing into the vast expanse of the Arabian Sea. Naturally with the sea at sway, Poovar also sports a luxurious beach along the trails of its coconut palms lined glorious sands.</p>
<p>The rustic charm of Poovar complements perfectly the growing luxury appeal of its many star rated establishments, thereby presenting tourists with a delightful mix of the pristine and the pure, the elegant and the mesmerising. There’s diverse flora and fauna at play, while even the seemingly ordinary sights are no less spectacular; coconut groves, fishermen going about their chores, floating cottages- all present a picture of a heaven hitherto undiscovered. There’s even an alluring estuary nearby Poovar that remains resplendent also in the same relaxing vibe and natural abundance. In its yet unspoilt confines, Poovar harbours an aura that caters to every touristry desire- of the quaint and the peaceful as also of the picturesque and the magical.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9589" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Neyyar-Dam.jpg" alt="Neyyar Dam" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Neyyar-Dam.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Neyyar-Dam-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Neyyar-Dam-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>An idyllic spot for a relaxing day out in the open, the Neyyar dam is a man-made wonder that makes for among the rare places to visit in Trivandrum. In fact, Neyyar is a lake cum dam that is built over the Neyyar River and makes for a really enthralling spot encompassed by the Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary. With the breathtaking Western Ghats as the backdrop, the Neyyar Dam makes for a really amazing picnic place.</p>
<p>The panoramic presence of the lake amidst the majestic standing of the dam makes this place a marvel in many wonders. Undisturbed by the chaos of the world and deep seated in its offering of splendid serenity and unbounded natural bounty, the region makes for a really enchanting place to while away your Trivandrum sojourn. There’s obviously rich flora and diverse fauna inhabiting this ecologically vibrant place. But the Neyyar dam and the surrounding locality also houses many rare medicinal herbs within its offbeat ambit. For visitors to the capital of God’s very own country, this is one rare discovery that will leave you deeply satiated and immensely rejuvenated.</p>
<h3><strong>4- Veli Lake and Tourist Village</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 12 km from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: ₹10–₹20 (boat rides extra).</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 20 min drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Boat rides, floating bridge, photography.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9592" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Veli-Lake.jpg" alt="Veli Lake" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Veli-Lake.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Veli-Lake-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Veli-Lake-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Among the most charming lakes in Kerala yet only a rare tourist attraction, the Veli Lake should certainly be among the list of places you would visit on a <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/trivandrum-tour-packages" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trip to Trivandrum</a>. Located some 12 kilometers away from the city, the tourist village is a really pretty destination with its locational nestling at the confluence of the Veli Lake and the Arabian Sea. In fact the village sits pretty exotically on the sand bar that separates the two water bodies and oversees therefore the crystal waters of the underlying lagoon.</p>
<p>There’s ample activities that you can indulge in the many waters that define the allure of Veli. In its splendid stretch of backwaters and the lush expanse of its many paddy fields, the scene is one of a breathtaking contrast on canvas. Shades of green as vivid as the strokes of blue define this quaint place that is a visual treat to savor in all its glory. A floating bridge and some amazing stone and grass sculptures further up the exotic quotient of this charming place that definitely is a worthy tourist attraction in all its exquisite offerings.</p>
<h3><strong>5- Kappil Backwater</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 7 km from Varkala.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Free (boat rides extra).</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 20-30 min drive from Varkala.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Walk along the estuary, enjoy sunsets, boat rides.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9587" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kappil-Backwater.jpg" alt="Kappil Backwater" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kappil-Backwater.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kappil-Backwater-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Kappil-Backwater-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The Kappil backwaters aren’t exactly among the rare tourist places in Trivandrum but compared to how abundantly explored backwaters in Kerala tend to be, it does not exactly feature as one of the must visit attractions. Situated a mere 7 kilometers away from the very popular beach destination of Varkala, the sheen of the Kappil backwaters seem to remain mired in relative obscurity. In fact the majestic beauty of the backwaters together with the astounding expanse of the sea makes also the Kappil beach a tourist destination of unparalleled magnificence altogether. Amazing sunset and sunrise views further compound the beauty of this place that remains resplendent even in its largely relaxing vibe.</p>
<p>The Kappil Pozhi estuary that separates the sea from the backwaters makes for an amazing walkway, one where you can enjoy a leisurely stroll even as panoramic views and the gentle sea breeze soothes your body and soul. The coconut lined sandy strip makes for such a stunning view that the place remains one of the most photographed across Kerala! Reclusive in its touristry presence yet not in any way lacking in the appeal, hardly would you discover a beauty like Kappil even in your sojourn across the world.</p>
<h3><strong>6- Kowdiar Palace</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: Kowdiar, Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Not open to the public.</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: N/A.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Year-round.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 5 km from the city center.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Admire architecture from outside.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9404" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum.jpg" alt="Kowdiar Palace, Trivandrum" width="900" height="590" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum-300x197.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum-768x503.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>That Kerala is mainly celebrated as a land of verdant greenery and swaying waters, of beachy allure and coastal glory perhaps explains why an architectural specimen as striking as the Kowdiar Palace in Trivandrum makes for among the rare places that tourists tend to visit. In its structure, the palace is a simple manifestation of architecture, yet it is by no means any less exemplary a specimen than other flamboyant illustrations. Even historically the Kowdiar Palace holds significance as Maharajah Sree Chithira Thirunal built it for the wedding of his only sister, Maharani Karthika Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi.</p>
<p>A really unique wooden structure, one that even boasts an elevator made of wood, the Kowdiar Palace makes for a grand sight even in its ‘rooted’ existence. A three storeyed building that rears its majestic bearings from among the verdant expanse of Trivandrum, the palace is a lofty sight with its six steeples and an equally breathtaking wonder in the picturesque garden of greenery that nestles it. The Kowdiar Palace indeed is an encompassment of the simplicity that describes Kerala, flamboyant in its natural endowment and alluring even in its minimalism. There truly is no ode to beauty that does Trivandrum better humanly than the Kowdiar Palace.</p>
<h3><strong>7- Azhimala Beach</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: Near Kovalam (25 km from Trivandrum).</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Free.</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Mar.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 30 min drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Beach walks, visit Azhimala Shiva Temple, sunset views.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9585" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Azhimala-Beach.jpg" alt="Azhimala Beach" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Azhimala-Beach.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Azhimala-Beach-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Azhimala-Beach-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Azhimala might be another of the many beaches that dot Kerala but in its quiet splendor it remains one of those rare places that needs to be a feature of the itinerary of every visit to Trivandrum. Just some few kilometers away from the world class appeal of Kovalam, the allure of Azhimala resides in its quaint, calm existence that renders it nothing short of a paradise. The setting is one that is undoubtedly idyllic, the vibe permeating through its serene prettiness speaks of solace and contentment, and in the expanse of almost nothingness would you encounter a peace so alluring that you would want to stay there forever. Of course there are coconut fringed shores that sit pretty daintily with the majestic Azhimala hill as the backdrop. There also is the Azhimala Shiva Temple nearby for you to seek spirituality in, intermingled with solace and tranquility.</p>
<h3><strong>8- Bonacaud</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 40 km from Trivandrum, in the Agasthya Hills.</li>
<li><strong>Entry Fee</strong>: Free (trekking requires permission).</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 1.5–2 hours drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Trekking, visit tea estate, explore waterfalls.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9586" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bonacaud-Estate.jpg" alt="Bonacaud Estate" width="900" height="518" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bonacaud-Estate.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bonacaud-Estate-300x173.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Bonacaud-Estate-768x442.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>A small village hamlet in Trivandrum, Bonacaud is also a really pretty picnic spot. A sprawling encompassment of natural beauty in its array of valleys, waterfalls and hills, Bonacaud also is the lesser known base station of the famous peak, Agasthyarkoodam in the Agasthya hills of the Western Ghats. What however strikes a different tone amidst the abundant beauty and verdance tract that defines every aspect of Kerala and also bonacaud is the presence of supposedly among the most haunted places in the state. That’s a chill that the Bonacaud Bungalow encompasses, that in its misty presence and obscure existence stands very much as a ghostly ground. There also however exists an abandoned tea factory that also adds its own dose of horror to Bonacaud.</p>
<p>Naturally in its abundant peaks and trails, Bonacaud is also a trekker’s paradise. Flora and fauna dot the region as does gurgling streams and crystal waters making it the true encompassment of nature in all its vibrancy. Bonacaud perhaps is no different than any other touristry attractions in Kerala, yet it remains one of the rare places to visit in Trivandrum if you are a soul forever in awe of as much of natural exuberance as the world can grant.</p>
<h3><strong>9- Muthalapozhi</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 29 km from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Mar.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 45 min drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Visit estuary, sunset views, beach walks</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9588" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Muthalapozhi-Port.jpg" alt="Muthalapozhi Port" width="900" height="580" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Muthalapozhi-Port.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Muthalapozhi-Port-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Muthalapozhi-Port-768x495.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>A seaside village that rests just 29 kilometers away from the city of Trivandrum, Muthalapozhi might not strike exactly as a tourist wonder with its seemingly ordinary stature which is why it finds expression as one of the rare places to visit in Trivandrum. But as the place that defines the confluence of the Vamanapuram River and the Arabian Sea, the sleepy hamlet sure is no walkover either. Like all other places that emerge to be prettier with the merge of the backwaters and the sea, Muthalapozhi also is steeped in all of that exquisite beauty. An unending seascape, really stunning sunset views, an array of beach activities and unending allure of serenity- Trivandrum sure couldn’t have got any more ordinarily exotic than this!</p>
<h3><strong>10- Ponmudi</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: 60 km northeast of Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Timings</strong>: Open all day.</li>
<li><strong>Best Time</strong>: Nov–Feb.</li>
<li><strong>How to Reach</strong>: 2-hour drive from Trivandrum.</li>
<li><strong>Things to Do</strong>: Trekking, visit tea gardens, photography.</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9594" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ponmudi.jpg" alt="Ponmudi" width="900" height="519" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ponmudi.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ponmudi-300x173.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ponmudi-768x443.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Ponmudi might be exactly the rarest of places to visit for a tourist, but as a hill station with all the charms it still dwells somewhere in obscurity. A mist covered valley that harbours the robust allure of the teas and also the prettiness of its ample floral diversity, Ponmudi is a really captivating vista of all-encompassing beauty. Sitting conveniently at some 60 kilometers from Trivandrum, Ponmudi definitely is worthy of your visit as among the rare places that has all the elements of making you feel like you are in the midst of true blue paradise.</p>

<h3><strong>The importance of travelling rests also on the plate!</strong></h3>
<p>Travelling isn’t just about collecting introspective experiences and having cultural enlightenment though. Venturing into newer lands is also your best bet of letting your taste buds savor the authentic taste of the place. Trying out new cuisines in the most indigenous way possible is the best way to satiate the foodie soul in you. Not only does it impart the local flavours and the local taste but also is the best way to do away with all drooling at the sight of every fancy foreign dish on social media. Traditional food and traditional customs are best explored the traditional way, so take your next travel journey as the way you need to go about for rendering that offbeat taste to your tongue.</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling enriches you</strong></h3>
<p>Travelling also enriches you with experiences. Your life becomes an amalgamation of the most interesting stories, of incredible happenings and diverse encounters that is your treasure for life. By rendering you richer in experiences and memories, travelling can also further your creative pursuits.

<p>It isn’t also only the beauty that beckons you into exploring the world. Travelling is important because it also makes you culturally informative and historically enlightened. While there are folks who travel just for the sake of it, travel is as much an experience to be lived as it is cherished.</p>
<p>Roaming the alleys of forts and palaces deeply seethed with history or seeking rich cultural experiences through discovering age old legacies is the best way to be aware of the world you live in. Travelling is also more effective an educational tool than education itself! Such is the importance of travelling that we seek respite in travel and also sap excitement out of it!</p>

<h3><strong>Travelling enlightens you</strong></h3>
<p>By making you more accustomed with diverse facets of different parts of the world, travelling also enlightens you. It makes you see the world in a different light, one that need not necessarily be as rosy or as dark as your own existence. From teaching you to adjust and compromise, get accustomed and uninhibited, travelling basically sets you up for life. Like we said earlier, travelling is education- the kind that educates you to ace life itself.</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling sets you up for life</strong></h3>
<p>By expanding your knowledge, travels also enhances your prospects in life. You learn and relearn so much by travelling that life comes surprisingly easier to you. Because you would have witnessed comfort and adventure all in once, you know how to tackle life situations better. You are always prepared for the worst even when you don’t give your hope of the best. That’s just how practical travelling helps you be. In teaching you to view life through a colored glass, travelling ensures you aren’t just stuck with the basic monochromatic version of the world.</p>
<h3><strong>Traveling gets you going (literally and figuratively!)</strong></h3>
<p>When you are out on a travel sojourn, you cease to be preoccupied with life’s tiring musings. Even when you travel just because you like it, travelling still serves your purpose. In being even your addiction, travelling gets you going on the high. You tend to soar like a free bird, far removed from the regular humdrum of monotonity. Naturally, when you travel, your stress somehow loses its intensity of having you worried. And that’s just the perfect way you need to live life. Travelling lets you while away your stress without as much a damn as life expects out of you.</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling also leads the way to your soul</strong></h3>
<p>Travelling also lets you connect with yourself. Specially when you travel solo, you get this deeper introspection into life and into your own soul. The solitary times help you discover your essence and perceive your own existence in a very different understanding. That’s perhaps the best point to enumerate about the importance of travelling. Because knowing oneself inside out is crucial to living a life of fulfillment and clarity, one that will not drive you to disenchantment.</p>
<p>Also, when you travel, you have a deeper sense of the vastness this entity called the world encompasses. This makes you realise just how minuscule our lives are, just how unnecessarily occupied we remain with our own bodings even when we are as insignificant as anyone else. In manifesting your own triviality, travelling teaches you to be modest and humble.</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling is lifetime investment</strong></h3>
<p>Travelling as an action might be fleeting but the many memories of that wonderful bachelorette trip will linger on all life long. Many a time, it is these eras lived that help you tide over life when things aren’t particularly easy. But even otherwise, travelling gifts you such moments of pleasure and fun that are ever lasting, memories that will make you smile in fond remembrance every time you drift off to wonderland.</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling is an adventure in itself</strong></h3>

<p>Treading new terrains, dealing with unknown people and finding your way through hitherto unfamiliar lands can sound a bit intimidating but as you master the art of travelling, you will begin to view such unfamiliarity as something adventurous rather than offsetting. Travelling becomes all the more exciting when it is challenging. Even when you are travelling in some quaint, sleepy town, maneuvering through the lesser known place is what keeps you upbeat about experiencing this adventure called travelling. Travelling is as much a rush of adrenaline as it is a surge of excitement. And once you have successfully made it through such an experience, you would acknowledge how travelling also boosts your confidence and leaves you craving for more and more of such adventure.</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling is wholesome entertainment!</strong></h3>
<p>It might not be so obvious but planning a travel trip is as exciting as travelling itself! The anticipation of the long awaited trip and even the intricacies of packing and sorting, of booking and prepping have you as much excited as the travel day itself. It is also in this expectation of living a new experience, of joining in with all the hustle and bustle that makes travelling all the more enticing and thrilling. Because the journey is worth more than the destination and travel lets you know exactly why this has been the universal saga all throughout.</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling is Instagram goals</strong></h3>
<p>However superficial this might be, there’s no denying how breaking it on Insta keeps us all hooked in the times of today. In fact, people now travel as much for their social life as for their own pleasure. The excitement of travelling to new places increases manifold at the anticipation of how your latest vacation pics will be the talk of the grammars. It is also this excitement of being talked about that drives many to travel in the modern world. You might not be agreeing on this particular ‘importance of travelling’ but to the extent it makes you feel good about showing off your latest plunge, travelling indeed is goals!</p>
<h3><strong>Travel is also the worthiest leisure</strong></h3>
<p>Leisure in today’s world is a luxury. One that therefore must be efficiently utilised so as to make every moment matter. There’s no luxury in the world that transcends the ecstasy of travel. In enriching you with experiences, in letting you de- stress, in making you happier, travelling is the worthiest luxury you can buy.</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling makes you happy</strong></h3>

<p>Travelling also makes you happier. By reducing stress, by helping yourself let loose, by rewarding you with the most luxurious of experiences, travel has a way of making the heart go fonder and happier. For many, travelling is freedom. The importance of travelling is all the more manifested in it being a delightful break from the monotony of routine and the boredom of schedule. In being an experience so liberating, travelling instantly perks up your mood and leaves you happier.</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling will be your most exclusive luxury</strong></h3>
<p>Not just exquisite, travelling is also exclusive to you. It is one of those very few experiences that you share only with yourself. Because travelling affects different people differently, your individual experience is only your own. That as a thought itself is so relaxing, of having something very intimate with the world, of something that is not forged but created. Travelling is so exclusive to you that even when it makes you humble it also leaves you resplendent in a pride of connecting so deep to the world.</p>
