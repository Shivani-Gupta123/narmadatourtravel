Get stuck in, and by making a difference to underprivileged communities all over the world, you\u2019ll be learning from the people\u2019s lives you\u2019ll be benefiting too. Often, whilst volunteering, you\u2019ll live within a \u2018home stay\u2019 which provides the perfect opportunity to get to know a local family and sample their way of life. We can\u2019t say we\u2019d complain too much about trying out the local food either!<\/p>\n<p>The best thing about volunteering is there is loads of choice placement wise too, from wildlife conservation to community work and teaching, and by building up on your volunteering experience, such as within the teaching field, it\u2019ll provide you with the ideal skills for getting stuck in in the workplace too. Remember there\u2019s lots of variety too\u2026 when you book to volunteer through gap year or volunteering companies, you could find placements which will see you work with pandas in the heart of rural china, on a Big 5 game reserve in South Africa or teaching in underdeveloped Malawi.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TEFL- Teach abroad, and have loads of fun<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you\u2019re looking to take your teaching experience up a gear then head to China and teach abroad and gain the TEFL qualification. By going out to China a month early with your TEFL course, and getting hands on teaching experience in country before you start your proper placement, the TEFL qualification offers an impressive boost for any CV, as well as being a stand out component at any job interview. Who else can say they\u2019ve spent six months teaching Chinese children in Xi\u2019an, or in the buzzing Shanghai? It\u2019ll show your easily adaptable and willing to learn.<\/p>\n<p>If you then did decide to go to uni, having teaching experience under your belt before you start is a fantastic introduction to your course.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Internships<\/strong><br \/>\nIt\u2019s a well-known fact that dedicating your time to intern within a professional environment will be beneficial for your CV, but adding the added element of moving abroad will only impress employers even more. Moreover, there are opportunities all over the world within a professional arena- such as marketing, which could see you move to South America, or China- which has one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies.<\/p>\n<p>Not only that, but becoming acclimatized to a different culture and a different working environment will make your CV stand out and look incredibly attractive to employers- which is perfect if you\u2019re looking for that extra boost.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Living Abroad<\/strong><br \/>\nWant to get stuck into life on the other side of the planet? Go for it! By upping sticks and moving to another country, you\u2019ll prove your willing, adventurous and not afraid to take on a challenge. Partner this with worthwhile activity- such as volunteering or work experience, and you\u2019ll be able to provide more than other candidates and have something incredible to talk about at the interview stage.<\/p>\n<p>You could fund your time away by applying for a working holiday visa- which can be done in a variety of countries around the world. Each year, a limited number of candidates can apply to work in Canada, and you can stay abroad for up to two years.<\/p>\n<p>Australia is the most popular option among young British and European travelers, and with only one working holiday visa in Aus up for grabs in your lifetime (before your 30), this is an opportunity not to be missed. Work in Aus is limited to \u2018casual work\u2019 (ie- hospitality, retail, temping for up to three months at a time, labouring etc) but by introducing that added element of working abroad, you\u2019ll be showing initiative and willing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do a mixture!<\/strong><br \/>\nCan\u2019t decide what suits you the best? By trying alternative types of travel- such as within a group with a tour guide, with friends and then solo. Not only will you have an amazing time when you\u2019re away, but you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ve had the chance to grow as a person and get ready for the working environment too!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Looking to boost your CV and employability, but not sure whether you want to go to university or college to advance your education?
