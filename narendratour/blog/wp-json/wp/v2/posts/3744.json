There&#8217;s something exciting and fascinating about visiting a city that&#8217;s been populated for five thousand years or more. Imagine what hotel guides looked like three thousand years when people would crave living quarters in bedrock and then connect them using catacombs. Large wheels of stones controlled by a lever separated the levels and provided security for guests.<\/p>\n<p>Ancient travel destinations are becoming popular on travel websites where lists of old and colorful cities around the world are touted as the birthplace of a particular religion or the home of a biblical character. Most experienced artifacts and relic hunters travel to Turkey to find the oldest of the old cities since Turkey has a plethora of temples and mosaic museums as well as rain and wind eroded volcanic formations that redefine the meaning of the word old.<\/p>\n<p>Europe and Asia are filled with ancient sites that claim to be the older than dirt. Experts argue about which city is actually the oldest inhabited city, but most people agree that Old Damascus is the winner. Varanasi, India could also be crowned the oldest inhabited city in the world. That title depends on the next archaeological dig that turns up the remains of another ancient civilization that keeps moving the clock of humanity back a few thousand years.<\/p>\n<p>The ancient city of Ur which is now the modern-day Iraqi city Tell el-Muqayyar is considered the cradle of civilization by some historians, and other Archeologists say Matera, Italy has been inhabited since Paleolithic times so it holds a special spot on the wall of antiquity.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The Top Five Ancient Cities to Put on Your Must See List<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Traveling through ancient times is always a trip to remember. You get a taste for age and cultural creativity when you visit these cities:<\/p>\n<p><strong>01.
