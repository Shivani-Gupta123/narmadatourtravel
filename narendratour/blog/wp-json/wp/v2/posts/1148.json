In 1982, Valley of Flowers was announced as World Heritage Site plus National Park. UNESCO recognized this vale as \u2018Heritage\u2019 because it was discovered that some very vital medicinal herbs grow naturally in the Valley of Flowers. We can relate this fact to the myths easily. According to Hindu mythology, Hanuman Ji picked the Sanjeevani Booti from this very region to save the life of Lakshmana who received fatal wounds at a battlefield.<\/p>\n<p>The flowers that bloom in the \u2018Valley of Flowers\u2019 belong to some of the rarest species and the most renowned ones are Cobra Lily, Brahma Kapal, Blue Poppy.
