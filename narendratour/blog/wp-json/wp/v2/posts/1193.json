This travel information guide below will provide you all the necessary info.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>History<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Khajuraho.jpg\" alt=\"Khajuraho - Khajuraho Travel Guide\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7287\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Khajuraho retains a special glory amongst the best known World heritage sites of India. The temples of Khajuraho are amongst the most stunning historical monuments of India. It\u2019s estimated that these temples were all built by the Chandela rulers between the periods 900 AD to 1130. The Chandela Rulers were earlier known as Bargujar Rajputs who were Shiva worshipers. Khajuraho was the capital of Chandel kingdom and it remained the cultural capital even after Mahoba was appointed as capital later. This period was the epitome of the Chandela rule and each ruler had at least one temple to his credit. Broadly speaking, temple building was a custom amongst the Chandela rulers and almost all other rulers of the Chandela Clan.<\/p>\n<p>The first temple of Khajuraho is believed to have been built (according to literary accounts by Abu Rehan al Beruni in AD 1022 and the Arab Scholar Ibn Battuta) around 1000 AD. Khajuraho town was the religious capital of Khajuraho. There was a huge wall with 8 inbuilt gates surrounding Khajuraho and each gate was flanked by two fully grown date trees. It was because of the date (Khajur) trees that the place got its name as Khajur Vahika. Alternatively Khajuraho was also known as Jejakabhukti.<\/p>\n<p>After the Chandela dynasty fell from power post 1150 the temples of Khajuraho were disfigured badly by Muslim invaders and they suffered destruction. Local people were forced to leave Khajuraho because of the ruthless attack of Muslims. Historical lore says that the local townsfolk decided that if they left the town then invaders would spare the sanctity of the temples. Thus from the 13th century to 18th century the temples of Khajuraho remained under dense forest cover shielded away from eyes of the world before being discovered by British Engineer T.S Burt.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Culture<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Temples of Khajuraho have prominent posters in the Tourist Office of India and they have also been depicted in the temple grounds. Many famous dancers and musicians have given recitals with the famous Khajuraho temples in the background. However Khajuraho has mostly claimed the limelight because of the constructs of sexuality that feature in the temple architecture. The sheer fluidity of the lines and the eroticism of the figures have been referred to as an example of the liberal attitude of India. Gays and Lesbians have often cited Khajuraho as the epitome of expressions of sexual freedom.<\/p>\n<p>Some scholars opine that the erotic statues of Khajuraho are often interpreted as sexual intercourse positions between divine beings, gods and goddesses. The temples that have such carvings and sculptures stand at some distance from the cluster of Jain temples and Hindu temples. The outer wall sculptures demonstrate the life style of common members of the society during the medieval age.<\/p>\n<p>10th Century famous poetic and literary work like Karpuramanjari, Kavyamimansa, Prabodhacandrodaya etc are represented thematically in the sculptures of Khajuraho. Other interesting iconography includes Vrik Vyala (fusion of lion and wolf) and Gaja Vyala (fusion of lion and elephant).\u00a0 The stories about temple architecture abound in the small town of Khajuraho and are expressed by locals through their art and craft.<\/p>\n<p>Khajuraho is a town steeped in rich history and culture and fabric of social life here is fascinating.
