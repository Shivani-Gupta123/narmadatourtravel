There are many hill stations located around  Gaya Bihar and have great transport connectivity to the capital city of  Gaya Bihar as well. So if you have a mind to visit any of these hill stations, visiting  Gaya Bihar first is quite indispensable. Read on to learn more in details about the hill stations around  Gaya Bihar.<\/p>\n<p>When the British made  Gaya Bihar their capital, the sweltering heat in summer simply became unbearable and led to their developing hill resorts around  Gaya Bihar. Their legacy survives and undoubtedly, the most famous of them all is Shimla, the queen of hill stations and their summer capital. Shimla still has remnants of British culture to remind us of the colonial past. That is not the only hill resort around  Gaya Bihar. There are dozens, some very popular and some not so well known; some close by and some at a distance, but each a pearl in its own way. So take your pick.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Hill Stations According to Direction:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Go west to Himachal and it is a veritable paradise. Shimla, Kasauli and Manali are inarguably the most famous with Dalhousie, Kufri and Dharamshala equally popular. Then there are other less popular resorts such as Solan, Renukaji, Kandaghat and Chail. Go North to Kashmir and you have the ever-popular Yousmarg, Sonamarg and Gulmarg with Srinagar a city resort you can enjoy just as much as the more remote hill stations. Go North-East to Uttaranchal and here you have some lovely resorts of which Nainital, Kausani and Mussoorie are undoubtedly the most beloved of tourists. Then there are others such as Ranikhet, Kanatal, Binsar, Chamba, Ramgarh and Auli to keep you enchanted and cool during sweltering summer months. Haryana has Morni and Rajasthan to the South West has Mount Abu but this is at quite a distance. Your best bet would be to choose popular resorts located closer to  Gaya Bihar.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The Not So Well Known<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>People rush off to well-known spots but these can be crowded. Why not choose not-so-well-known spots for some peace and quiet? One such resort is Kangojodi, a pristine, unspoilt place where you can enjoy solitude. Everyone rushes off to Kullu but Tirthan in the same valley is about a day\u2019s drive from  Gaya Bihar and is more beautiful and enchanting. Not many have heard of Churwadhar, about 90 Km from Simla but it is off the beaten track and lets you commune with Mother Nature. Just as isolated is Chindi near Solan where you can lose yourself in the tranquility and recharge your batteries. Mandi is on the road to Manali and is a hidden sanctuary next to Prashar Lake.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The Famous and the Popular<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>01. Auli<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/auli.jpg\" alt=\"Auli\" width=\"700\" height=\"400\" \/><br \/>\nAbout 500 kms from  Gaya Bihar, this charming resort is in Uttarakhand and its pride is the longest cable car that takes you on a 4 kilometer journey giving an enchanting view of the lovely terrain.

Most of all it is as yet unspoilt and is relatively calmer for a soul refreshing sojourn.<\/p>\n<p><strong>06. Nahan<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4584\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Rani-Tal-Shiv-Temple-Nahan-Himachal-Pradesh.jpg\" alt=\"Nahan\" width=\"700\" height=\"457\" \/><br \/>\nYou may not have heard of this reclusive retreat about 260 km from  Gaya Bihar, located in the Shivaliks but it is picturesque and quiet, perfect for a soliloquy with nature.

You could spend days doing nothing and still not feel bored. You can just as well go trekking, boating or bird watching. Take some time off to visit Tip n Top, the Regimental Museum, Bhim Pakora and the Tarkeshwar Mahadev Temple. If you time your visit for the Autumn Festival the resort takes on a festive air and you will enjoy your trip all the more.<\/p>\n<p>With so many hill stations accessible so easily from  Gaya Bihar, you could well ask yourself before you decide as to what exactly you want from this trip.

As for transportation, there are plenty of buses that will take you to  Gaya Bihar or you can join a tour or hire a private cab. On a Friday evening close your eyes, move the mouse on the map at random and click to select at random. Pack your bags and set off for a weekend of sheer delight.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p> Gaya Bihar is an important stop-over for tourists before they can move to other popular tourist spots.
