With 21 vessels currently in operation, Carnival is not only one of the most recognizable names in cruise travel, but also the largest. With multiple classes of cruise ships including: Fantasy, Destiny, Spirit, Conquest, Splendor, and the Carnival Valor, the Carnival operation can be divided amongst luxury, family and adult-friendly themes. The Carnival Sensation, built in 1993, has been in operation since its launch and has offered adults a fantasy vacation for less within its Fantasy class of travel. Carnival Sensation cruises have become a popular choice amongst both singles and adult couples who want to escape from the redundancy of their 9 to 5 for a memorable vacation overseas and docks at Nassau, Bahamas.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2943\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Ship-Hop-Cruise.jpg\" alt=\"Ship Hop Cruise\" width=\"700\" height=\"486\" \/><br \/>\nWith so many cruise lines to choose from, and even more ships within these specific cruise lines, choosing the perfect ship to step foot on can be a daunting task. Trust the Carnival Sensation cruise ship reviews claiming the experience to be truly \u201csensational\u201d when booking your next week long venture to unknown territories and charters. The experience has recently improved with the 2009 refit that included an overhaul and the addition of 98 private balconies to the ocean view rooms available to be booked online.<\/p>\n<p>The beauty of traveling by cruise rather than plane is that you can enjoy every moment of your vacation without being bogged down by connecting fighting and boring air time. The minute that the ship leaves the dock the party starts within the Fantasia Lounge, Polo Lounge, Plaza Lounge, and Seaview Bar &amp; Grill just to name a few. With a cruise line that is fully stocked with activities, entertainment, delicious dining and drinks, as a traveller you no longer need to worry about planning each day of your vacation. Simply check out the daily events and activities listed in your daily bulletins, and you can pick and choose last minute and enjoy your voyage without stress or anxiety.<\/p>\n<p>Within the Sensation are sensational rooms of all types. The Fantasy class cruise ships have a high percentage of inside cabins and the top two suite categories offer balconies. Rooms include the 1100 sq ft Owner\u2019s Suite, the 330 sq ft suite, the Balcony 186 sq ft suite, the Oceanview cabin of 186 sq ft and the lowest priced inside cabin, which measures to 186 sq ft. While many assume all cabins have limited space, this ship is well designed with more than enough storage and closet space for bags and garments. While the standard suites have a simplistic decor that is warm and inviting, suites are embellished with seating areas and refrigerators for comfort and convenience. With 22 staterooms designed for wheelchair accessibility, all guests will be impressed with the size and set up of their cabin no matter what pricing criteria.<\/p>\n<p>There is no limit to the activities abroad for all of the family. With children\u2019s activity rooms, parents can trust their little ones are in good hands and well entertained the whole time. The refurbishments to the Carnival Sensation cruise liner added not only a 9-hole mini golf course, but also children\u2019s water park complete with slides and splash areas, as well as a much-appreciated adult\u2019s only Serenity deck. These are just a few of the favorites on the list of things to do in the wonderful world of cruising.<\/p>\n<p>A common appreciation goes into the unlimited food options that are included in the cost of traveling via a cruise ship. On board the Carnival Sensation cruise restaurants serve open-seating breakfast and lunch every day the cruise is in operation. Don\u2019t miss dinner, as the restaurant dinners are served in assigned seating sessions during specific time frames throughout the night. The Lido buffet and Seaview Bistro are also available as alternative dining spots, complete with self-serve ice cream, pizza and even a sushi bar. For those who prefer to eat in, room service is always available.<\/p>\n<p>Carnival sensation cruise ship reviews rave about the on board casino, complete with slots and tables for travelers to enjoy while voyaging through the water on the way to the Bahamas. After the sun sets, the shows put on nightly are entertaining, funny and amazing, and will impress all.<\/p>\n<p>Amenities abroad do not differ much from what is included in a four-star resort on land. With in-cabin safes, WiFi, fitness classes, gym, hair salon, a sauna, spa, steam room, five bars, dance club, library, showroom, video game room, laundry services, computer room and children\u2019s programs, all of your bases are covered from point A to point Z. Visit Carnival online, or call your trusted travel agent to book your next Carnival Sensation cruise, and be amazed and astounded by the luxury and brilliance this cruise liner offers all. Travel abroad and enjoy your stay on the ship just as much as your venture on land in Nassau, Bahamas.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Carnival cruise lines, based in Miami, as the Florida, have been conducting the business of pioneering inexpensive cruise travel since 1972.
