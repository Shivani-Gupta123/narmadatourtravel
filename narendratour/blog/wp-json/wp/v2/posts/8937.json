His Holiness Drubwang Padma Norbu Rinpoche, popularly known as Penor Rinpoche, envisioned the monastery as a spiritual haven that would preserve the ancient wisdom of Tibetan Buddhism and disseminate its teachings to the world.<\/p>\n<p>The establishment of the Namdroling Monastery was a result of the exodus of Tibetan refugees to India following the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1959. The monastery provided a sanctuary for the Tibetan community and became a centre for the revival and preservation of Tibetan culture and spirituality.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Architecture<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The architecture of Namdroling Monastery is a testament to the rich Tibetan Buddhist tradition. The main attraction of the monastery is the Golden Temple, which is adorned with intricate murals, colourful frescoes, and ornate decorations. The temple houses three colossal golden statues of the Buddha, Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava), and Amitayus (the Buddha of Infinite Life), each standing at a height of 40 feet.<\/p>\n<p>The monastery complex also includes several prayer halls, meditation halls, and residential quarters for the monks and nuns. The vibrant colours, intricate woodwork, and traditional Tibetan designs create a visually stunning experience for visitors.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Best Time to Visit<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The Namdroling Monastery can be visited throughout the year. However, the best time to visit is during the Tibetan New Year, which usually falls in February or March. During this time, the monastery comes alive with vibrant festivities, traditional music, and dance performances.
