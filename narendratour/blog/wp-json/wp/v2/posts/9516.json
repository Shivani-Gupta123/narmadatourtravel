This fall into disgrace was too much to bear for the officer who committed suicide while going on a stroll along the tunnel. Dead and buried in the tunnel vicinity might have led the Colonel\u2019s ghost to famously haunt the place as local beliefs and \u2018feels\u2019 have established.<\/p>\n<p>Many people have indeed felt the presence of Mr Barog inside his namesake tunnel. Wandering in and about the station and the tunnel, Barog\u2019s spirit seems to be inspiring eeriness in what is the straightest tunnel in the world. But in spite of famously haunting the route, Mr Barog is seen as a friendly ghost, who is even up for talks and laughs with the people!<\/p>\n<p>But not just Mr Barog can claim the fame for the tunnel which in fact was constructed by another engineer who came after him. Local lores has it that there is another man who goes about the tunnel asking matchsticks to light his cigarette and even a woman who go screaming in and just vanishes into thin air from there! We don\u2019t know how much petrifying this sounds but the dampness of the abandoned tunnel of premise sure holds something sinister at play.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>9- Taj Mahal Hotel, Mumbai<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Iconic hotel linked to the 26\/11 terror attacks.<\/li>\n<li>Said to be haunted by the spirit of its chief architect, W.A.
