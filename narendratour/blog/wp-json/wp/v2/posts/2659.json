Deciding where to go, what sights to visit, how to get there, when to jet off and when (if ever) you will be coming back home are all things that need to be thought through and planned. We can put so much time into organizing the little details of our trip, that we sometimes forget the most obvious things we need to plan. Here\u2019s a checklist of 5 things you cannot go traveling without; however in-depth your itinerary may be.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Passport<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3442\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Passport.jpg\" alt=\"Passport\" width=\"700\" height=\"438\" \/><br \/>\nWe had to put the most obvious one first, as you\u2019re really not going anywhere without this. It\u2019s not just that you have to remember to pop your passport in your hand luggage; you also need to check when it is due to expire. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re planning on traveling the world for a year, but your passport runs out in 6 months, you\u2019re going to need a new one! Some countries won\u2019t let you through the border if you have less than a few months on your passport, so bear this in mind before you set off. There are passport offices located around the UK for you to renew or replace, such as a passport office in Durham for those that are North East based. Find your local office and get up to date, quickly!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Travel Insurance<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2919\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Travel-Insurance-for-Pensioners.jpg\" alt=\"Travel Insurance for Pensioners\" width=\"700\" height=\"486\" \/><br \/>\nTechnically you could go traveling without insurance, but what if something were to happen? It\u2019s not just to cover you for illness or injury, travel insurance also covers you for items that may get lost or stolen. Those who have stayed in hostels before will know that your stuff isn\u2019t 100% secure all of the time, and there\u2019s been many a traveler story of things going missing. Make sure you\u2019re fully protected for any eventuality.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Backpack<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3439\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Backpack.jpg\" alt=\"Backpack\" width=\"700\" height=\"495\" \/><br \/>\nNo traveler is complete without their backpack! If you\u2019re feeling risky then you can get backpacks or rucksacks that fit within hand luggage rules, meaning you can take it on the plane with you. We say this is risky because it means you will be able to bring very few things with you. However, if you like the idea of washing your only t-shirt in the Ganges then this is the option for you. Those who want to bring more stuff should go and try out backpacks in the shop, to get a good feel of what is comfortable on them.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Camera<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3440\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Camera.jpg\" alt=\"Camera\" width=\"700\" height=\"552\" \/><br \/>\nYou can\u2019t travel around the world and not have photographic evidence; its traveler blasphemy. Invest in a compact, but good quality, camera that you can take with you everywhere you go. Every time you get to an internet cafe make sure you upload the photos you already have to a cloud server, your e-mail or Facebook. This makes sure that none of the photos you take get lost, whether because the camera is stolen or because you drop it!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>First Aid Kit<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3441\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/First-Aid-Kit.jpg\" alt=\"First Aid Kit\" width=\"700\" height=\"319\" \/><br \/>\nThis is one essential piece of traveling kit that so many people forget to take with them, because they think it is unnecessary. You\u2019ll be surprised at how many things you can do with a first aid kit; from patching up a hole in your bag to comforting a sprained ankle. Ensure you have the basics with you, such as bandages and antiseptic wipes, along with some painkillers, antihistamines and a needle and thread.<\/p>\n<p>Five very different things, all that is a vital part of the traveler\u2019s kit. Have you taken anything traveling with you that you would recommend to everyone else? Is there one item that you swear by having in your backpack? Let us know and share your traveling wisdom.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The thought and planning that goes into traveling can be extensive, as well as exciting.
