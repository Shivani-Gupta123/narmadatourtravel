Originating in Miami, Florida, it is the newest and most beautiful ship you will find to take you on the cruise vacation of your dreams.<\/p>\n<p>With a sailing itinerary of 7 days, travelers have the opportunity to choose either an Eastern Caribbean or Western Caribbean destination. The Eastern Caribbean cruise will take you to such ports as Nassau, Bahamas, St Thomas, USVI, as well as St. Maarten. The choice to visit Western ports will have your travel destinations include Belize, Roatan Island, Honduras, Grand Cayman, The Cayman Islands, as well as Cozumel in Mexico.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2924\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Carnival-Valor.jpg\" alt=\"Carnival Valor\" width=\"700\" height=\"560\" \/><br \/>\nWith a Panamanian registry, the Valor will hold 2,974 passengers, with a crew numbering 1,180. This tremendous vessel boasts a weight of 110,000 tons, and measures 1,000 feet long. It has a total of 1,487 staterooms, spanning 13 decks. Five hundred and fifty-five of these have private balconies. Featuring a theme of Heroes and Heroics, the Americana found in the d\u00e9cor is comforting, inspiring, and most of all, fun!<\/p>\n<p>Stateroom accommodations vary, with interior rooms offering the best value. They are comfortably appointed with a private bath, television, drawer and closet space, and two double beds that convert to a double size bed. All televisions have satellite access and show major network channels as well as cable news and movies.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, staterooms are available with ocean views and balconies, with an upgraded reservation. Suites are more luxurious, boasting a larger and more luxurious space, as well as dynamic views. In most cases, it will also feature a large closet and soaking tub in the bath. Beautiful and spacious family suites make traveling with the kids an easy venture. However, with a ship such as this, why worry about your room? Carnival Valor cruise reviews are bursting with positive things to say about the amazing journey to be had on a well-priced and beautiful luxury cruise.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to agree with the Carnival Valor cruise reviews when you learn about the many things to do and see while traveling with Carnival. For starters, young or old, the cruise ship will make your journey one to remember. Children under the age of two have a play area targeted to their age, with soft surroundings to keep them safe. In the evening, you can take advantage of ship employed baby-sitters to ensure your children are happy while dancing or dining the night away.<\/p>\n<p>Camp Carnival is an atmosphere designed for kids aged 2 to 11, with activities and supervision to keep busy. Circle \u201cC\u201d is a program for kids ages 12-14 that features all the things these young teens enjoy doing. Video games, dancing, movies and Karaoke are all on the itinerary for these sailors. For those a little bit older, who may not fit in with the younger set but still are not quite old enough to enjoy the adult venues, Club Oz is a perfect fit. Those ages 15-17 are welcome to stop in or stay, enjoying age-appropriate music, video games, terrific food and the opportunity to hang out at all hours with the new friends they make. For parents, this is especially helpful, as all of these activities and clubs are well supervised.<\/p>\n<p>The Valor has three pools, including one that features an awesome slide that is known as The Twister. With twists and a height equal to three decks, it\u2019s fun for any age.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, a person can watch movies in their stateroom, but with an available 12\u2019 by 22\u2019 outdoor theatre, why would anyone want to? This screen is clear and has a 70,000 watt sound system so everyone who wants to hear the movie can do so.<\/p>\n<p>Other shipboard activities include games, to include Survivor, the Newlywed Game and Family Feud, as well as the traditional deck games to be expected. Musicals, juggling acts and Broadway-inspired theatre will keep you entertained. Nine holes of miniature golf can be played, and a beautiful exercise facility will keep away the guilt of a dining indulgence. The luxurious spa can accommodate men and women, with everything imaginable to feel invigorated and refreshed.<\/p>\n<p>At the Shogun Club Casino, you can enjoy playing the slots, card games and roulette. The Bronx Sports Bar will keep the sporting enthusiast happy with all the games and scores, and Winston\u2019s Cigar Bar and Jeanne\u2019s Wine Bar offer a quiet place to relax and visit with friends.<\/p>\n<p>If you wish to stay in touch with someone back home, the internet caf\u00e9 is available, but as the entire ship is computer friendly, you can bring along your laptop and have service anywhere on board. You can also find just the right book to savor poolside at the Iliad Library. Kids will enjoy learning about science or geography, as well as other subjects, in a 4200 square foot area just for them. The Caboose is a fully supervised kid\u2019s dance club for those who want to get moving.<\/p>\n<p>Dancing and dining for the adults is really a highlight of the journey. Carnival Valor cruise ship reviews suggest that this ship is one that will offer as much as, if not more fun on-board then the port destinations traveled to.<\/p>\n<p>Food and fun will be top on the list for the grownups. Formal dining at the Washington or Lincoln Dining Room\u2019s offer world class culinary masterpieces served by gracious staff. For an additional fee per person, The Scarlett Dining Room is a more exclusive supper club, with fine wines and seafood, as well as steaks and pasta. The more casual meal can be enjoyed on the Lido Deck, where you might feel a little bit more relaxed, but the excellent food continues to be served. For the kids, this dining also means pizza and an ice cream bar.<\/p>\n<p>Late night snacks are always available, and room service is free. Thinking of the perfect cup of morning coffee, however, may just bring you to the Java Caf\u00e9, where you can enjoy the perfect premium coffee and delight in a pastry in this European style coffee bar.<\/p>\n<p>The Carnival Valor cruise ship is an amazing and wonderful travel experience for anyone seeking a relaxing and budget conscious get away. No sacrificing of fun or dining need be made, and wonderful ports of call always make for a memorable vacation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Carnival Valor cruise ship is waiting to sail away, with you on-board!
