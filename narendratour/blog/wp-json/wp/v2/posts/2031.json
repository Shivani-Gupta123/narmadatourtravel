Bhopal is also known as the Lake City for it consists of a number of natural lakes. Bhopal is one of the greeniest cities of India. The city bears several historical monuments. In fact, the old city has a happy blending of Hindu and Islamic culture tradition and modernity. Bhopal has a Master Control Facility to control the movements of satellites, the second such installation in the country established by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) in 2005.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Madhya Pradesh<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Madhya Pradesh is the central province of India and is the second largest state in India after Rajasthan (it was the largest till the year2000 when Chhattisgarh was carved out of it). Madhya Pradesh borders Uttar Pradesh in the north, Chhattisgarh in the east, Maharashtra in the south and Gujarat and Rajasthan in the west.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>History<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The city of Bhopal was founded by Paramar king Raja Bhoj of the 11th century AD. The city was originally called \u2018Bhoja pal\u2019 after Bhoj and the pal (dam to form lakes surrounding the city). The high days of the city, however, declined with the fall of the Paramaras and the subsequent pillage and plundering.<\/p>\n<p>In early 18th century after the last vestiges of the Mughal Empire collapsed, an Afghan soldier from Orakzai tribe called Dost Mohammad Khan laid out the city newly. He also brought Islamic influence on the culture and architecture of the new city. Later, Dost Mohammad met Queen Kamalapati and went on to establish his hold over the entire region. Bhopal survived Maratha onslaught in the late 18th century and finally signed a peace treaty with the British in 1818.<\/p>\n<p>From 1819-1926, Bhopal was ruled by four women rulers. Qudsia Begum was the first female ruler of modern-day Bhopal, succeeded by Sikandari Begum, followed by Shah Jehan Begum (she was labeled as the \u2018First Lady of India\u2019 by the British) and finally Kai Khusrau Jahan Begum was the last female ruler. The Begums said to have started development works in the city in the form of waterworks, railways and postal system. Bhopal was among the last princely states to have signed the Instrument of Accession during the time of India\u2019s independence in 1947. Bhopal joined the Indian Union in May 1949. After independence, Sindhi refugees from Pakistan were accommodated in western suburbs of Bhopal.
