Mount Kailash, considered the sacred abode of Lord Shiva, and the nearby Lake Mansarovar hold a revered place in these religions. Undertaking this journey is a significant endeavor due to the challenging mountainous terrain and unpredictable weather conditions. However, for those who seek a more convenient way to experience this pilgrimage, the helicopter route offers an efficient and less physically demanding alternative.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9152\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Kailash-Mansarovar-Yatra-by-Helicopter.jpeg\" alt=\"Kailash Mansarovar Yatra by Helicopter\" width=\"900\" height=\"544\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Kailash-Mansarovar-Yatra-by-Helicopter.jpeg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Kailash-Mansarovar-Yatra-by-Helicopter-300x181.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/Kailash-Mansarovar-Yatra-by-Helicopter-768x464.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Advantages of Choosing the Helicopter Route<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Time Efficiency<\/strong>: The helicopter route significantly reduces travel time compared to traditional trekking routes. While the traditional routes can take up to three weeks, the helicopter route typically takes between 5 to 11 days. This makes it an ideal choice for individuals with limited time but a deep desire to undertake this sacred journey.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cost-Effectiveness<\/strong>: Opting for the helicopter route can be more economical. For instance, the helicopter tour offered by NamasteIndiaTrip is priced around Rs 1,85,000, which is often less expensive than the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) organized trips. This cost-effectiveness makes the yatra more accessible to those on a budget.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Simplified Medical Requirements<\/strong>: The helicopter route involves less physical exertion than the traditional trekking routes, leading to more lenient medical evaluations. This is particularly beneficial for those who may find the rigorous health checks of the MEA routes challenging.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reduced Risk<\/strong>: The helicopter journey involves minimal trekking and significantly lowers the risks associated with high-altitude travel. Most of the journey is conducted via air travel, thus reducing the physical strain on participants.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h4>Detailed Itinerary of the Helicopter Route<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Day 1: Arrival in Kathmandu<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Upon arrival in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, you will be transferred to your hotel. This day is dedicated to resting and acclimatizing to the local environment. After checking in and freshening up, you will have the opportunity to explore Kathmandu\u2019s main attractions, including its vibrant markets and historic temples. You will spend the night at your hotel in Kathmandu, preparing for the next leg of your journey.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 2: Travel to Nepalgunj<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The following morning, you will embark on a flight from Kathmandu to Nepalgunj. Nepalgunj is a key transit point for the <a href=\"\/kailash-mansarovar-yatra\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kailash Mansarovar Yatra<\/a>. Upon arrival, you will be transferred to your hotel where you will have the chance to rest. A briefing session will be conducted to inform you about the upcoming journey. This meeting provides an opportunity to address any questions or concerns you may have. After a relaxing evening and dinner, you will spend the night at the hotel in Nepalgunj.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 3: Journey to Simikot and Hilsa<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On the third day, you will take a flight from Nepalgunj to Simikot. Simikot is a small town in the Humla District and serves as a transit point before heading to the Tibetan border. After a short rest and refreshment break in Simikot, you will board a helicopter to Hilsa. Hilsa is located near the border of Tibet and is a crucial point for crossing into the Tibetan region. After arriving in Hilsa, you will drive to Purang, where you will check into a hotel for an overnight stay.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 4: Acclimatization in Purang<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The next day is dedicated to acclimatization in Purang. Given the high altitude, acclimatization is crucial to adjust to the reduced oxygen levels. Short acclimatization treks may be conducted to help you adapt. This day allows you to prepare for the higher altitudes you will encounter later in the journey. You will spend the night at a hotel in Purang.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 5: Visit to Lake Mansarovar<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The fifth day involves a drive from Purang to Lake Mansarovar in an air-conditioned Volvo bus. The drive takes approximately 2 hours and offers scenic views of the Tibetan landscape. Upon reaching Lake Mansarovar, you will be able to perform the \u2018parikrama\u2019 (circumambulation) of the lake, a significant ritual in the pilgrimage. The lake, considered sacred, is also a place where many pilgrims take a holy dip. This day is spent near the lake, and you will stay overnight at accommodations near Lake Mansarovar.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Day 6: Drive to Darchen<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>From Lake Mansarovar, you will drive to Darchen, a small town at the base of Mount Kailash. Darchen serves as the starting point for the \u2018parikrama\u2019 (circumambulation) of Mount Kailash. The journey from Lake Mansarovar to Darchen is relatively short, allowing you to rest and prepare for the trek around the sacred mountain. Overnight stay is at a hotel or guesthouse in Darchen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Days 7-9: \u2018Parikrama\u2019 of Mount Kailash<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The \u2018parikrama\u2019 of Mount Kailash, a key component of the pilgrimage, typically spans three days. This circumambulation of the mountain is performed in a clockwise direction, which is considered spiritually auspicious. The trek is physically demanding but rewarding, offering profound spiritual experiences. Pilgrims often find this part of the journey both challenging and fulfilling. The trek will lead you back to Darchen, completing the parikrama.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Days 10-11: Return Journey to Kathmandu<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>After completing the \u2018parikrama,\u2019 you will retrace your steps back to Kathmandu. The return journey follows the same route used for arrival, involving a helicopter ride from Darchen to Hilsa, followed by a flight to Simikot, a flight to Nepalgunj, and finally, a flight back to Kathmandu. From Kathmandu, you will catch your flight back home, concluding your sacred journey.<\/p>\n<h4>Preparing for the Yatra<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Health Considerations<\/strong>: Despite the helicopter route being less physically taxing than trekking routes, altitude acclimatization is crucial. Ensure you are in good health and consult with a healthcare provider before undertaking the journey.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Documentation<\/strong>: Ensure all necessary permits and documentation are in order before departure. This includes travel permits for Tibet and any specific requirements for the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Travel Insurance<\/strong>: Consider purchasing comprehensive travel insurance that covers high-altitude travel and any potential medical emergencies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Packing Essentials<\/strong>: Pack appropriately for high-altitude travel. This includes warm clothing, sturdy walking shoes, and essential medications.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Local Customs and Etiquette<\/strong>: Familiarize yourself with local customs and practices to show respect during your pilgrimage.<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"\/kailash-mansarovar-yatra-by-helicopter.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kailash Mansarovar Yatra by helicopter<\/a> offers a unique opportunity to experience one of the most sacred pilgrimages in a more accessible and less physically demanding manner.
