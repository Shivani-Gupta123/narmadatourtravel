According to all the holy Hindu books, taking a pilgrimage to these 4 spiritual portals will grant them with moksha or the freedom from the karmic cycle of birth and rebirth. All the four portals are dedicated to different gods and goddesses which are \u2013 Kedarnath (Lord Shiva); Badrinath (Lord Vishnu), Gangotri (goddess Ganga), and Yamunotri (Goddess Yamuna), and taking this holy pilgrimage will enable you to have the ultimate spiritual experience that cannot be found anywhere else and some people even take this journey more than once in their life.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Can Senior Citizens Over the Age of 70 Make this Journey?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The holy Char Dham sites can be easily accessed by senior citizens since the government always makes constant approaches towards the betterment of these Dham sites. With the advent of helicopter services and other alternative ways of travelling like dolis and ponies making the pilgrimage journey is now easier and more comfortable than it ever was before. There are regular food and tea stalls available everywhere. All the surrounding hotels are also accommodated with various services meant for the convenience of the senior citizens and to help them accommodate better with the harsh weather conditions.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Will I be provided with Medical Facilities During the Yatra? <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>All the Char Dham camps are equipped with first aid facilities in the Char Dham camps which along with a number of medicines and bandages also contain oxygen cylinders for the Yatras suffering from altitude sickness. The government has also set up medical relief posts to help people looking for emergency medical checkups. It also advised for the Yatris to carry their own set of first aid boxes with all the emergency and relevant medical items that one may need during the time of an emergency.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What are a Few Essential Items of Travel that I should not Forget to Bring?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Planning to pack for your Char Dham Yatra is one of the most hectic things that you will be experiencing. One thing is common that the weather conditions here are extremely cold and by night it gets freezing. Do not underestimate the weather in this case and here are a few important and highly relevant things that you should always include: a first aid kit, thermals, winter accessories like woolen gloves, mufflers, scarves, a backpack for carrying items like torches, spare batteries, chocolates, portable charger, etc. also make sure to carry a raincoat, good pair of comfortable walking shoes and mosquito repellant.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What is the Safest and the Best Time to Go on Char Dham Yatra?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Going for the Char Dham Yatra during the opening months of May to June and then again during the closing months of September to November are considered to be the best time to visit Char Dham Yatra. Avoid going on Char Dham Yatra during the monsoon months of July to September. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/chardham-yatra-by-helicopter\">Helicopter services<\/a> during these times are suspended owing to the bad and unexpected weather conditions. The entire region remains prone to landslides and torrential rains. Make sure before booking and confirming your tickets or package to the Char Dham portals, that you are not going during the rainy seasons since you may even end up losing a lot of money.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Are There Any ATMs Available in and Around the Char Dham Sites?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>ATMs are not a widely available service and facility in and around Char Dham sites. It would be a wise option for you to withdraw out some cash before commencing the journey on available places. Although there are ATMs available in the nearby pilgrimage towns that fall en route on your journey to the holy destinations.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What Kind of Accommodation Facilities Will I Get?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>All the Char Dham sites have a good range of stay options available. You will be able to choose from staying in government guesthouses and camping sites to budget-friendly hotels and even luxury resorts of 3 to 4-star categories. Although most of the facilities everywhere are almost the same which comprises of running hot and cold water facilities, warm bedding and a comfortable stay. Some hotels also have a built-in restaurant available in order to make the availability of food easier for the guests. People also choose to stay in the nearby holy towns that offer a much more pleasant stay option.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What is the Best Way to Book My Char Dham Yatra?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Booking your Char Dham Yatra is a lot of work if you choose to go on your own without the help of any travel agency. It is better to book your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/chardham\">Char Dham Yatra<\/a> journey via a travel company who has been doing it since a long time. It will save you a lot of time and unnecessary hassle. You can go through the reviews of people who have already gone on the Yatra and choose the company that appeals to you the most and caters to your requirements. Generally, the company will ask you for some advance payment to get you the hotel of your choice. In order to confirm the booking you will be required to do 100 percent of the payment.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What are the Perks of Going on Char Dham Yatra by Helicopter?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Apart from the obvious deduction in the time taken to complete the Yatra journey, you will also be given the priority Darshan pass to every Dham on your arrival.
