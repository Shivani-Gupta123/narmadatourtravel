The name has been coined from an ancient temple called Chandi Mandir located close to the city. Chandigarh is the first planned city in India featuring numerous architectural works of Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret, Matthew Nowicki and Albert Mayer, some of the greatest architects in the world history. Chandigarh ranks at the top of all states and Union Territories in terms of per capita income. Chandigarh is the capital of both the states of Punjab and Haryana since 1966. The city is a significant base of the Indian Airforce and other defence establishments. Chandigarh, along with Panchkula and Mohali is known as Chandigarh Tricity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>History<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2067\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Rock-Garden-of-Chandigarh.jpg\" alt=\"Rock Garden of Chandigarh\" width=\"700\" height=\"431\" \/><br \/>\nFollowing the partition of India and with that also the partition of Punjab, the Indian part of Punjab required a new capital. The existing settlements were found to be inadequately equipped to be made a capital and hence the decision was taken to set up a totally new planned city. Subsequently, Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India commissioned Chandigarh and Le Corbusier set up plans for several buildings and projects in the city. However, Corbusier was not the first man to have worked on the Chandigarh urban project. Before him, American architect-planner Albert Mayer and Polish architect Matthew Nowicki worked on it. Corbusier was called up following Nowicki\u2019s death in 1950. In 1966, when Haryana was created as a Hindi-speaking state out of Punjab, Chandigarh, owing to its location on the border, served as the capital of both states. In 2007, Chandigarh became the first Indian city to have banned smoking in public places.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Geography<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The city of Chandigarh is located near the foothills of the Shivalik range of the Himalayas in northwest India.
