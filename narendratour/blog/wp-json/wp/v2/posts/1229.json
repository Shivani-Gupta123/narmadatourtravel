He founded a new religion \u2018Buddhism\u2019 which now is a major religion worldwide and nationwide. There are a huge number of Buddhist pilgrimage destinations in India where pilgrims from all round the world make a bee line. Each of these places is intricately connected with Lord Buddha. To know more on Buddhist pilgrimage in India, read on-<\/p>\n<p>The 6th century ascetic Buddha who showed the whole world the path of light and divinity is now worshipped by almost 1\/3rd of the human population. Buddha is a religious icon who is known to inspire devotion and faith even in on followers i.e. non Buddhists. Devout Christians, Hindus and people of all other religions are likely to be inspired by the holistic and expansive principles of Buddhism. Gautam Buddha has strong roots in India and there are many places here that rightfully claim the top position in the Buddhist Pilgrimage circuit in India.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Caturmahapratiharya or the Four Great Wonders<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There is very little information available about the origins of Buddhist Pilgrimage sites as Buddhism first began as an offshoot of Hinduism before commanding its own set of traditions. According to the Mahaparinibbana Sutta Buddha instructs his primary disciple Ananda about the four places of light and power which every spiritual person should look upon. The four places are Lumbini (birthplace of Lord Buddha), Bodh Gaya (attainment of realization), Sarnath (disbursement of teaching) and Kushinagar (Buddha passed away).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lumbini<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1230\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/The-World-Peace-Pagoda-Lumbini.jpg\" alt=\"The World Peace Pagoda Lumbini\" width=\"700\" height=\"383\" \/><br \/>\nLord Buddha or Prince Siddhartha as he was known then was born in the middle of a lovely garden called Lumbini; there is a giant Asokan Pillar at the exact spot in the garden bearing the words \u201chere is the birthplace of Buddha\u201d. Lumbini is on the Indo Nepal border. You can stay at Bhairawa and then obtain the permit to visit Lumbini before returning back to Bhairawa.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bodh Gaya<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3259\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Bodh-Gaya.jpg\" alt=\"Bodh Gaya\" width=\"700\" height=\"486\" \/><br \/>\nBodh Gaya was known as Uruvela in Buddha\u2019s time and it was the seat of inspiration for all the earlier Buddha\u2019s of Buddhism along with Gautama Buddha. All the future Buddha\u2019s are also expected to attain enlightenment at this place. Bodh Gaya is also fondly called the center of the Buddhist Universe and Navel of Earth. Right at the center of the town is the Mahabodhi temple which has the Buddha tree behind it, all the mystic surrounding shrines make up the Buddha\u2019s seven weeks in Gaya. There is a lot of international tourist traffic in Bodh Gaya and you can see the hundreds of beautiful pink lilies in the lake. Other beautiful spots here are the Niranjana River and the Bodhi tree (especially during the full moon). At one part of Bodh Gaya there is an 80 feet Japanese Buddha statue. If you are interested in gaining knowledge about Buddhism then contact the Root Institute, Mahabodhi Society and Korean Temple.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sarnath<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1232\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Sarnath-Chaukhandi-Stupa.jpg\" alt=\"Sarnath Chaukhandi Stupa\" width=\"700\" height=\"383\" \/><br \/>\nSarnath is just 15 km away from Varanasi and it is at the lovely deer park of Sarnath that the Buddha preached his first two discourses. Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta and Anattalakkhana Sutta are the two great discourses he taught. The ruined gardens of Sarnath are still full of the mystic relics of Buddha and it is a profound spiritual experience to just stroll through the garden. Pilgrims would also like to check the Asoka Pillar, Dhamek Stupa and the Mulagandhakuti Vihara. If you are interested in Indo Buddhist art then don\u2019t miss paying a visit to the Sarnath Museum. Apart from this there are interesting Burmese, Korean, Tibetan, Chinese and Thai temples in Sarnath.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Kushinagar<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1236\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Kushinagar.jpg\" alt=\"Parinirvana Stupa\" width=\"700\" height=\"420\" \/><br \/>\nMahaparinibbana Sutta contains a moving account of the final years of Gautama Buddha and the last few moments he spent at Kushinagar or Kusinara. Buddha was said to rest his body between two sal trees and draw hi last breath and attain Parinivana\/nirvana. There is a beautiful Nirvana temple built right at this spot and ruins of ancient monasteries are artistically presented amidst the gardens. Interestingly Kusinara is full of Sal trees. There is a museum in Kusinara containing authentic Buddhism relics which you can visit. You can try staying at Gorakhpur while planning a visit to Kusinara.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Four Sites of Buddhism Miracles<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>As the religion of Buddhism gained Momentum there was special impetus placed on four sites where miraculous events had taken place in context of Lord Buddha. These four sites collectively known as Rajgriha symbolized the height of power of Buddhism; Rajgriha, Sravasti, Vaishali, Smakasya.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sravasti<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1237\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/sravasti-buddha-temple.jpg\" alt=\"sravasti buddha temple\" width=\"700\" height=\"400\" \/><br \/>\nSravasti\u2019s principal attraction today is the ancient historical resort called the Jetavana which was built by the rich businessman Anathapindika. This place was preferred a lot by Buddha who spent the 20 last monsoons of his life there. There are many monasteries near Jetavana and they are set artistically amidst fragrant gardens. The Buddha preached many discourses here and also performed a miracle wherein he tamed a mad elephant. If you are interested in gaining further knowledge about Buddhist then do read the Angulimala Sutta which is available here. Don\u2019t miss paying a visit to the State Museum and the Sri Lankan Temple here. It\u2019s easy to reach Sravasti from Lucknow.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Sankassa\/Sankasya<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1238\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Sankassa-Uttar-Pradesh.jpg\" alt=\"Sankassa Uttar Pradesh\" width=\"700\" height=\"400\" \/><br \/>\nAfter attaining enlightenment Lord Buddha was approached by his deceased mother in his dreams. Legend has it that she asked to hear his discourse and Buddha promised to visit her at her heavenly abode. For three months Buddha was in Tusita heaven tutoring his mother on Abhidhamma. Later he descended from heaven at the place Sankassya. Obviously this place holds a very special significance for Buddhists as Ashoka emperor erected one of the pillars here.. Sankassya is difficult to reach but it is well connected to Sravasti.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Vaishali<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1241\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Vaisali-Bihar.jpg\" alt=\"Vaisali Bihar\" width=\"700\" height=\"385\" \/><br \/>\nVaishali was said to be one of the most popular sites of Buddha and he held it in special affection. Many events occured in Vaisaly like a group of monkeys offering the Buddha honey and Buddha preaching his sermon to Ambapali a prostitute. It is said the Lord Buddha delivered the Maha Sihanada Sutta or the long discourse over here. After a century post the nirvana attainment of Buddha a historic council was held in Vaishali and monks all over India participated in it to redefine the charts of Buddhism for the future. If you visit Vaishali then don\u2019t forget to see the Asoka Lion Pillar, Japanese temple, Kharauna Lake and Stupa built over Vijjans (containing the ashes of Buddha). The only place to stay in Vaishali is the government tourist bungalow.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rajgir<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1242\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Rajgir-Pegoda.jpg\" alt=\"Rajgir Pegoda\" width=\"700\" height=\"383\" \/><br \/>\nThe beauty and interesting terrain of Rajgir makes it a very popular religious Buddhist pilgrimage site. Rajgir is full of mystical ruins, dry forests, silent murmurs and majestic rocks. Rajgir was earlier known as Rajgriha and it was the capital of ancient state of Magadh (one of the biggest state of pre independence North India), there are several places of interest in Rajgir like the luscious Bamboo Grove, Cave of Devadatta, Cave of Satta Panna, mango grove of Jivaka, Pippilika Cave where Maha Kassapa liked to stay along with Boar\u2019s Grott. What really captivates the mind about Rajgriha is the beautiful white and golden Japanese Stupa that is situated on the hill of Ratana. There are multiple thermal springs around and these are excellent sites to have a hot bath. Rajgir is filled with Swetambara and Digambara Jain monks.<\/p>\n<p>This is an excellent place to educate yourself on the discourses of Lord Buddha, Monks suggest the following options.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Going up to the Vulture Peak point and reading Maha Saropama Sutta<\/li>\n<li>Going down to Boar\u2019s Grotto and reading Dighanaka Sutta<\/li>\n<li>Meditating in Jivaka Mango grove after reading Jivaka Sutta<\/li>\n<li>Relaxing in Bamboo Garden and reading Dantabhumi Sutta.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><strong>Pilgrimage Sites in other Parts of India<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Very few people know that the name Bihar is actually a derivation of Vihara which is a Buddhist place or worship or a monastery. Apart from the Buddhism sites which are mentioned above Bihar have innumerable other places which have a deep connect with Buddhism.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Gaya<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Gaya in Bihar is not as popular as its cleaner cousin Bodh Gaya it it too has a deep connection to Buddhism. Interestingly Gaya is also one of the seven most religious towns of Hinduism. Buddha stayed in Gaya for a long period of time and delivered one of his most powerful discourses; the third discourse there. The site of the sermon is called Brahmayoni and it is a steep hill that was earlier called Gayasisa. The Fire Sermon which has a lot of drama and imagery was delivered by Lord Buddha at Gaya. The depiction is beautifully described in the poem Wasteland penned by T.S Eliot. If you are really interested in the origins of Buddhism then a visit to the Gayasissa is compulsory. Another good place is Tankitamancha or as it is known now Sujikund. This is where Gautam Buddha encountered and defeated the evil spirit Suchiloma. The state museum there has a good collection of Buddhist sculpture.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Champanagar<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1245\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Champanagar.jpg\" alt=\"Champanagar\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\" \/><br \/>\nGautam Buddha paid multiple visits to Champanagar during his lifetime and called it his favourite Eastern haunt. Interestingly the city got its name from the hundreds of Champaka trees that grow there. Champak flowers are well known for their sweet and strong fragrance. Ancient town of Champanagar was the place where Gautam Buddha taught the Kandarka and the Sonadanda Sutta. There is a beautiful lake here which is filled with hundreds of blooming lotuses (the Buddha\u2019s favourite flowers). There is also a blue placid lake called Saravana Talib which is surrounded from all sides by Buddha statues.<\/p>\n<p>To reach Champanagar you have to take the road from Ganges to the Eastern Side of Bhagalpur via Patna.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Barabar Hills<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Barabar Hills were built by Emperor Asoka for the residence of the Ajivaka ascetics. The most prominent and beautiful of all this caves is the Lomas Rishi Cave that is fashioned out of gigantic chunk of Granite Hummock with an intricate wooden and thatch exterior. The cave has an interesting interior which is enhanced by large rectangular chamber with rare glass polish. Interestingly the cave looks like it has been cut by a modern laser. The book called Passage to India which is written by EM Foster has scenes describing the cave. The cave is at Kurkihar on the way between Rajgir and Gaya.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Indasala Cave<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1248\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Indasala-Cave.jpg\" alt=\"Indasala Cave\" width=\"700\" height=\"431\" \/><br \/>\nThis is quite a remote cave but is revered by Buddhist pilgrims all over the world for being the seat of one of the most famous discourses of Buddha; Sakkapanha Sutta.
