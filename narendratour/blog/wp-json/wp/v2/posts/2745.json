Thailand is also a very natural place to be in, it has great natural secrets and mind-blowing beaches.\u00a0 The biggest island in Thailand; Phuket, is one of the places you should not miss in Thailand.

Beaches:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There are around 15 beaches in Phuket which can be a mind luring set of nature. You can actually cruise down on these coastal areas and spend some quality time with your people. If you are from landlocked nation like Nepal, perhaps you will find them more interesting and fascinating.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Temples:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>What makes it more beautiful is its culture. The location is more devote to Buddhism and so you can find several Buddhist Temples to attract with their peaceful music and culture. There are some finely crafted temples which carry on the history and culture of some five hundred years or beyond. Although there are several temples and they are all very beautiful you should perhaps never miss the Wat Chalong. It is one of the best Buddhist temples with finest art and culture reflection.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Cuisine:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Where else can you find peace other than sitting on the beach looking at those cool calm oceans and taking taste of some fresh \u2013caught seafood to the local herbs as well as the homemade noodles that make Phuket popular? But still if you get to Phuket, you should try that seafood.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. Sunsets:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2752\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Sunsets.jpg\" alt=\"Sunsets in Phuket\" width=\"741\" height=\"352\" \/><br \/>\nWho wouldn\u2019t love to see sunset. Tourist guide say that most tourists get so much attracted with the sunset of Phuket they want to extend their stay just for it. Perhaps this is the best scene you can see here.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5. Nightlife:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The evening sunset and the market make it quite popular. The night is not sleepy here. The nightlife is rather lively. It doesn\u2019t have loud music parties on the night but the soothing music and night market makes it\u2019s nightlife rather impressive.
