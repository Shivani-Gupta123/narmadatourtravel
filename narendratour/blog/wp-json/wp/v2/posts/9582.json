Naturally, a land so pretty that it beckons even the heavens into its premises deserves a capital city that is no less charming and exquisite. And Trivandrum is the place that remains steeped in pride in being the capital of this really magnificent of all states in India. Thiruvananthapuram or Trivandrum is as exotic a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/kerala-tourist-attractions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tourist destination as Kerala<\/a> itself, earning it the epithet of the Evergreen City of India.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, residing in the plethora of natural wonders as it does, Trivandrum is no lesser a haven than the state it \u2018capitalises on\u2019. But even as a prime tourist destination, Trivandrum still harbours places that remain rare, in that they are less known names and lesser explored destinations. Here\u2019s a list of rare places to visit in Trivandrum so that you dare to venture on the road less taken on your next Kerala travel sojourn-<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1- Shanghumukham Beach<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: 8 km from Trivandrum city.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Entry Fee<\/strong>: Free.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Timings<\/strong>: Open 24\/7 (best during daylight).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Best Time<\/strong>: Nov\u2013Feb.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How to Reach<\/strong>: 15\u201320 min drive from Trivandrum.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Things to Do<\/strong>: Sunset\/sunrise, Sagarakanyaka sculpture, peaceful beach walks.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9591\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Shanghumukham-Beach.jpg\" alt=\"Shanghumukham Beach\" width=\"900\" height=\"551\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Shanghumukham-Beach.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Shanghumukham-Beach-300x184.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Shanghumukham-Beach-768x470.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While the entire expanse of Kerala abounds in beaches that make for really famous tourist destinations, it\u2019s indeed a surprise that a sandy expanse as definitive as the Shanghumukham beach in Trivandrum remains only a rare phenomenon when it comes to being one of the must visit places with the typical touristry appeal. In its white sands and exclusivity, the beach really is a splendid place to be in- one where you can remain unfazed by the bustle of life as well as the clamour of existence.<\/p>\n<p>An exquisite shoreline, vistas of serenity, beholding sunrise views and impeccable sunset experiences, there is no wonder of nature that Shanghumukham beach does not delight its visitors with. A very striking presence in this picturesque, isolated beach is an exemplary mermaid- the Sagarakanyaka &#8211; sculpted by renowned Indian sculptor Kanayi Kunhiraman. Also an exclusive location of the Arattu festival, the spectacular beach is undoubtedly a prime presence in the capital region of Kerala.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2- Poovar<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: 30 km south of Trivandrum.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Entry Fee<\/strong>: Free (boat rides extra).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Timings<\/strong>: Open all day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Best Time<\/strong>: Nov\u2013Feb.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How to Reach<\/strong>: 1-hour drive from Trivandrum.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Things to Do<\/strong>: Boat rides, visit floating cottages, explore beaches.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9590\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Poovar-Backwaters.jpg\" alt=\"Poovar Backwaters\" width=\"900\" height=\"511\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Poovar-Backwaters.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Poovar-Backwaters-300x170.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Poovar-Backwaters-768x436.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Poovar might be a tourist town in Trivandrum but it still remains among the rare places to visit given that it sits at a very southernmost point of the district. The magnificent beach that Poovar houses however is relatively well known. With its stunning natural beauty complemented perfectly by the pleasant weather, Poovar should make for a really ideal holiday detour. A pretty coastal village, more accurately an island, the view from Poovar encompasses the mighty Neyyar river confluencing into the vast expanse of the Arabian Sea. Naturally with the sea at sway, Poovar also sports a luxurious beach along the trails of its coconut palms lined glorious sands.<\/p>\n<p>The rustic charm of Poovar complements perfectly the growing luxury appeal of its many star rated establishments, thereby presenting tourists with a delightful mix of the pristine and the pure, the elegant and the mesmerising. There\u2019s diverse flora and fauna at play, while even the seemingly ordinary sights are no less spectacular; coconut groves, fishermen going about their chores, floating cottages- all present a picture of a heaven hitherto undiscovered. There\u2019s even an alluring estuary nearby Poovar that remains resplendent also in the same relaxing vibe and natural abundance. In its yet unspoilt confines, Poovar harbours an aura that caters to every touristry desire- of the quaint and the peaceful as also of the picturesque and the magical.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Suggested Tour<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/kerala-beaches-tour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kerala Beaches Tour Package<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>3- Neyyar Dam<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: 30 km east of Trivandrum.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Entry Fee<\/strong>: \u20b910\u2013\u20b920.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Timings<\/strong>: 8:00 AM \u2013 5:00 PM.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Best Time<\/strong>: Nov\u2013Feb.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How to Reach<\/strong>: 45-min drive from Trivandrum.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Things to Do<\/strong>: Boating, wildlife sanctuary, trekking.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9589\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Neyyar-Dam.jpg\" alt=\"Neyyar Dam\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Neyyar-Dam.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Neyyar-Dam-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Neyyar-Dam-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>An idyllic spot for a relaxing day out in the open, the Neyyar dam is a man-made wonder that makes for among the rare places to visit in Trivandrum. In fact, Neyyar is a lake cum dam that is built over the Neyyar River and makes for a really enthralling spot encompassed by the Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary. With the breathtaking Western Ghats as the backdrop, the Neyyar Dam makes for a really amazing picnic place.<\/p>\n<p>The panoramic presence of the lake amidst the majestic standing of the dam makes this place a marvel in many wonders. Undisturbed by the chaos of the world and deep seated in its offering of splendid serenity and unbounded natural bounty, the region makes for a really enchanting place to while away your Trivandrum sojourn. There\u2019s obviously rich flora and diverse fauna inhabiting this ecologically vibrant place. But the Neyyar dam and the surrounding locality also houses many rare medicinal herbs within its offbeat ambit. For visitors to the capital of God\u2019s very own country, this is one rare discovery that will leave you deeply satiated and immensely rejuvenated.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4- Veli Lake and Tourist Village<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: 12 km from Trivandrum.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Entry Fee<\/strong>: \u20b910\u2013\u20b920 (boat rides extra).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Timings<\/strong>: 9:00 AM \u2013 6:00 PM.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Best Time<\/strong>: Nov\u2013Feb.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How to Reach<\/strong>: 20 min drive from Trivandrum.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Things to Do<\/strong>: Boat rides, floating bridge, photography.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9592\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Veli-Lake.jpg\" alt=\"Veli Lake\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Veli-Lake.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Veli-Lake-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Veli-Lake-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Among the most charming lakes in Kerala yet only a rare tourist attraction, the Veli Lake should certainly be among the list of places you would visit on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/trivandrum-tour-packages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">trip to Trivandrum<\/a>. Located some 12 kilometers away from the city, the tourist village is a really pretty destination with its locational nestling at the confluence of the Veli Lake and the Arabian Sea. In fact the village sits pretty exotically on the sand bar that separates the two water bodies and oversees therefore the crystal waters of the underlying lagoon.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s ample activities that you can indulge in the many waters that define the allure of Veli. In its splendid stretch of backwaters and the lush expanse of its many paddy fields, the scene is one of a breathtaking contrast on canvas. Shades of green as vivid as the strokes of blue define this quaint place that is a visual treat to savor in all its glory. A floating bridge and some amazing stone and grass sculptures further up the exotic quotient of this charming place that definitely is a worthy tourist attraction in all its exquisite offerings.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5- Kappil Backwater<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: 7 km from Varkala.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Entry Fee<\/strong>: Free (boat rides extra).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Timings<\/strong>: Open all day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Best Time<\/strong>: Nov\u2013Feb.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How to Reach<\/strong>: 20-30 min drive from Varkala.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Things to Do<\/strong>: Walk along the estuary, enjoy sunsets, boat rides.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9587\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Kappil-Backwater.jpg\" alt=\"Kappil Backwater\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Kappil-Backwater.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Kappil-Backwater-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Kappil-Backwater-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Kappil backwaters aren\u2019t exactly among the rare tourist places in Trivandrum but compared to how abundantly explored backwaters in Kerala tend to be, it does not exactly feature as one of the must visit attractions. Situated a mere 7 kilometers away from the very popular beach destination of Varkala, the sheen of the Kappil backwaters seem to remain mired in relative obscurity. In fact the majestic beauty of the backwaters together with the astounding expanse of the sea makes also the Kappil beach a tourist destination of unparalleled magnificence altogether. Amazing sunset and sunrise views further compound the beauty of this place that remains resplendent even in its largely relaxing vibe.<\/p>\n<p>The Kappil Pozhi estuary that separates the sea from the backwaters makes for an amazing walkway, one where you can enjoy a leisurely stroll even as panoramic views and the gentle sea breeze soothes your body and soul. The coconut lined sandy strip makes for such a stunning view that the place remains one of the most photographed across Kerala! Reclusive in its touristry presence yet not in any way lacking in the appeal, hardly would you discover a beauty like Kappil even in your sojourn across the world.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>6- Kowdiar Palace<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: Kowdiar, Trivandrum.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Entry Fee<\/strong>: Not open to the public.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Timings<\/strong>: N\/A.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Best Time<\/strong>: Year-round.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How to Reach<\/strong>: 5 km from the city center.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Things to Do<\/strong>: Admire architecture from outside.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9404\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum.jpg\" alt=\"Kowdiar Palace, Trivandrum\" width=\"900\" height=\"590\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum-300x197.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Kowdiar-Palace-Trivandrum-768x503.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That Kerala is mainly celebrated as a land of verdant greenery and swaying waters, of beachy allure and coastal glory perhaps explains why an architectural specimen as striking as the Kowdiar Palace in Trivandrum makes for among the rare places that tourists tend to visit. In its structure, the palace is a simple manifestation of architecture, yet it is by no means any less exemplary a specimen than other flamboyant illustrations. Even historically the Kowdiar Palace holds significance as Maharajah Sree Chithira Thirunal built it for the wedding of his only sister, Maharani Karthika Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi.<\/p>\n<p>A really unique wooden structure, one that even boasts an elevator made of wood, the Kowdiar Palace makes for a grand sight even in its \u2018rooted\u2019 existence. A three storeyed building that rears its majestic bearings from among the verdant expanse of Trivandrum, the palace is a lofty sight with its six steeples and an equally breathtaking wonder in the picturesque garden of greenery that nestles it. The Kowdiar Palace indeed is an encompassment of the simplicity that describes Kerala, flamboyant in its natural endowment and alluring even in its minimalism. There truly is no ode to beauty that does Trivandrum better humanly than the Kowdiar Palace.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>7- Azhimala Beach<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: Near Kovalam (25 km from Trivandrum).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Entry Fee<\/strong>: Free.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Timings<\/strong>: Open all day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Best Time<\/strong>: Nov\u2013Mar.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How to Reach<\/strong>: 30 min drive from Trivandrum.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Things to Do<\/strong>: Beach walks, visit Azhimala Shiva Temple, sunset views.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9585\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Azhimala-Beach.jpg\" alt=\"Azhimala Beach\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Azhimala-Beach.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Azhimala-Beach-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Azhimala-Beach-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Azhimala might be another of the many beaches that dot Kerala but in its quiet splendor it remains one of those rare places that needs to be a feature of the itinerary of every visit to Trivandrum. Just some few kilometers away from the world class appeal of Kovalam, the allure of Azhimala resides in its quaint, calm existence that renders it nothing short of a paradise. The setting is one that is undoubtedly idyllic, the vibe permeating through its serene prettiness speaks of solace and contentment, and in the expanse of almost nothingness would you encounter a peace so alluring that you would want to stay there forever. Of course there are coconut fringed shores that sit pretty daintily with the majestic Azhimala hill as the backdrop. There also is the Azhimala Shiva Temple nearby for you to seek spirituality in, intermingled with solace and tranquility.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>8- Bonacaud<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: 40 km from Trivandrum, in the Agasthya Hills.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Entry Fee<\/strong>: Free (trekking requires permission).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Timings<\/strong>: Open all day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Best Time<\/strong>: Nov\u2013Feb.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How to Reach<\/strong>: 1.5\u20132 hours drive from Trivandrum.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Things to Do<\/strong>: Trekking, visit tea estate, explore waterfalls.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9586\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Bonacaud-Estate.jpg\" alt=\"Bonacaud Estate\" width=\"900\" height=\"518\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Bonacaud-Estate.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Bonacaud-Estate-300x173.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Bonacaud-Estate-768x442.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A small village hamlet in Trivandrum, Bonacaud is also a really pretty picnic spot. A sprawling encompassment of natural beauty in its array of valleys, waterfalls and hills, Bonacaud also is the lesser known base station of the famous peak, Agasthyarkoodam in the Agasthya hills of the Western Ghats. What however strikes a different tone amidst the abundant beauty and verdance tract that defines every aspect of Kerala and also bonacaud is the presence of supposedly among the most haunted places in the state. That\u2019s a chill that the Bonacaud Bungalow encompasses, that in its misty presence and obscure existence stands very much as a ghostly ground. There also however exists an abandoned tea factory that also adds its own dose of horror to Bonacaud.<\/p>\n<p>Naturally in its abundant peaks and trails, Bonacaud is also a trekker\u2019s paradise. Flora and fauna dot the region as does gurgling streams and crystal waters making it the true encompassment of nature in all its vibrancy. Bonacaud perhaps is no different than any other touristry attractions in Kerala, yet it remains one of the rare places to visit in Trivandrum if you are a soul forever in awe of as much of natural exuberance as the world can grant.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>9- Muthalapozhi<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: 29 km from Trivandrum.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Timings<\/strong>: Open all day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Best Time<\/strong>: Nov\u2013Mar.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How to Reach<\/strong>: 45 min drive from Trivandrum.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Things to Do<\/strong>: Visit estuary, sunset views, beach walks<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9588\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Muthalapozhi-Port.jpg\" alt=\"Muthalapozhi Port\" width=\"900\" height=\"580\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Muthalapozhi-Port.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Muthalapozhi-Port-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Muthalapozhi-Port-768x495.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A seaside village that rests just 29 kilometers away from the city of Trivandrum, Muthalapozhi might not strike exactly as a tourist wonder with its seemingly ordinary stature which is why it finds expression as one of the rare places to visit in Trivandrum. But as the place that defines the confluence of the Vamanapuram River and the Arabian Sea, the sleepy hamlet sure is no walkover either. Like all other places that emerge to be prettier with the merge of the backwaters and the sea, Muthalapozhi also is steeped in all of that exquisite beauty. An unending seascape, really stunning sunset views, an array of beach activities and unending allure of serenity- Trivandrum sure couldn\u2019t have got any more ordinarily exotic than this!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>10- Ponmudi<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: 60 km northeast of Trivandrum.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Timings<\/strong>: Open all day.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Best Time<\/strong>: Nov\u2013Feb.<\/li>\n<li><strong>How to Reach<\/strong>: 2-hour drive from Trivandrum.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Things to Do<\/strong>: Trekking, visit tea gardens, photography.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9594\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Ponmudi.jpg\" alt=\"Ponmudi\" width=\"900\" height=\"519\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Ponmudi.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Ponmudi-300x173.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/11\/Ponmudi-768x443.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Ponmudi might be exactly the rarest of places to visit for a tourist, but as a hill station with all the charms it still dwells somewhere in obscurity.
