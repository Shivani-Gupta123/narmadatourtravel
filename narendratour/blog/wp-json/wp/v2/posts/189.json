But since a major part of our population resides in the villages, it\u2019s equally important to explore rural India alongside the commonly visited tourist destinations of India. In fact, the beauty of rural India is no less than the well-known tourist spots. It\u2019s an un-spoilt virgin beauty of Mother Nature you would perhaps get nowhere else. To get the real essence of Indian culture, to sniff in the smell of raw earth or draw the whiff of the fresh blooms coming up with every changing season you do need to visit an Indian Village untouched by the evils of Industrialization.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s the reason many Travel and Tourism Companies offer Village Tourism Packages for enthusiasts. Often Students are taken for Village Tourism Tours because such tours are truly a learning experience for them. Visiting Rural India, which is rightly called the \u2018Heart of India\u2019 allows people to gain an understanding of the lifestyle of rural India; even at times participate in it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Key Advantages of Village Tourism are:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning something different from urbanization.<\/li>\n<li>Getting an opportunity to visit farmlands.<\/li>\n<li>Getting introduced to artisans and even purchasing locally manufactured handicrafts.<\/li>\n<li>Socio-economic development of the village.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With the increasing popularity of Village Tourism, many villages of India which were once totally unknown to the Nation and also to the world, have come to the fore and are frequented every year by tourists now.

You would get to smell here the fresh whiff of crops coming from the pastoral lands and as you wander about you could even have to hold your steps back because of the melodious strains emanated from a typical rural instrument called Masak been, quite similar to bagpipe or a tapping instrument, the Hudki player.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Diveagar Village:<\/strong> This is a coastal village situated at 170 Kms from the Tinsel town of Mumbai and about 156 Kms from the city of Pune. It is a part of the well-reputed Shrivardhan-Diveagar-Harihareshwar tourist route plan. The place is well famed for the Temple of Suvarna Ganesha consisting in a pure Gold deity of Lord Ganesha.
