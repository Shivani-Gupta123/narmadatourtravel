But not many know that coffee would not have reached Europe or the Americas if it were not for the Middle East.it was discovered in the 13<sup>th<\/sup> century and later on its use spread to Egypt and Yemen and had reached to the rest of the Middle East, Persia, Turkey, and northern Africa by the 16th century. From there it spread to Europe and to the Americas. In fact the word coffee is etymologically born from the Arabic qahwa.<\/p>\n<p>Coffee plays an important role in the Arabic culture. In the UAE and in Dubai, visitors will often be offered coffee, as well as tea when attending a business meeting or visiting someone at home. It is considered rude to decline coffee as offering it is a symbol of hospitality. Traditionally the coffee is poured from a brass pot with a long spout called the dallah into a small cup called the finyal.<\/p>\n<p>If in a traditional Arabic Coffee Shop one must keep the following points in mind:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you give the cup back to the server without shaking it, they will pour you another cup of qahawa.<\/li>\n<li>The right hand is used for drinking, eating and even offering food or drinks.<\/li>\n<li>You may need to be specific. Just saying coffee means you will be offered Arabic coffee. If you say Nescafe, American coffee will be served to you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Most places serve dates and a glass of water along with the not filtered or percolated but boiled) and served with a spice, usually cardamom. It is never served with milk. Arabic coffee is however different from Turkish coffee which is thicker and stronger.<\/p>\n<p>In most Arabic joints, tea is offered black and with sugar. It is called the Sulemani and usually the tea bag is left in the cup so that one can make it as strong as one wishes. One can also ask for the mint tea &#8211; basically a Sulemani served with mint leaf &#8211; which is truly refreshing<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1.

But until you have tried the two together or tried enjoying a cup while travelling with little kids you will not understand how ingenious and soul-satisfying the idea is. The ceramic items may range from bowls, coasters, cups, animals and mini Burj Al Arabs or Burj Khalifa of varying sizes.
