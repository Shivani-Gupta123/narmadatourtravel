India with its rich heritage and diversity has never disappointed travellers and thus India remains the tourist hub almost all around the year.

The wildlife and the scenic beauty capture thousands of tourists every year. It extends through a large area of 521 sq. km along with Sonanadi Wildlife Sanctuary which comprises the entire Corbett National Park of 1288 sq.km. Corbett is the destination of several animals with a wide variety of flora and fauna and birds. The park has taken complete responsibility of preserving the gifts of nature.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Through the Pages of History<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Several areas of the park were under Tehri Garhwal. A Terai tribe named Boksas resided in the place and started their own cultivation. But after the control of the British Raj the tribes were driven away from the land. The British officer Major Ramsay took effort to protect the forest area. During 1900 the land was suggested to establish a reserve park by several British officers like E.A. Smythies and E. R. Stevans. It came into being in 1936 under the governor Sir Malcolm Hailey from which its first name came. Later in 1954 bit was renamed as Ramganga National Park but finally, the name was changed again in 1966 after the name of the author and wildlife conservationist Jim Corbett. In the year 1973 Jim Corbett National Park was selected as the venue of a project named PROJECT TIGER. It is one of the biggest projects launched by all the wildlife preservationist and naturalist from different parts of the world.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>To Begin the Journey<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The nearest railway station to Corbett National Park is Ramnagar station which is 12 kms away from the park. Trains like Ranikhet Express and Kumaon Express halts at Ramnagar but one can easily opt for a more memorable journey through roadways.

The Park has been divided into five tourism zones namely- Bijrani whose gate is at Amadanda; Dhikala having gate at Dhangari; Jhirna whose gate is at Khara, Kalagarh; Domunda has gate at Durgadevi; Sonanadi has its gate at Vatanvasa.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Travel in the Park<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The entry fees for a day visit in different zones are Rs100\/- for Indian and Rs 450\/- for Foreigners. The vehicle fee ranges from Rs 250\/- to 1500 depending on the weight of the vehicle. The charge of commercial photography is Rs 500 for Indian and Rs 1500 for foreigners.

For the elephant safari one has to pay Rs 3000\/- and for the Ramganga conducted tour the tariff is Rs 1000\/- for Indian and Rs 2000\/- for foreigner.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Flora and Fauna<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The park is the home of several varieties of animals and plants. There are around 488 species of different plants. There are mountains and different forests all over the park. Herbs, tress, bamboos, climbers, grasses and ferns cover the flora.

Tigers are found in a different area from the other animals as they prefer solitude. But the female Tiger is seen with her cub. Tigers maintain a home range that is quiet distant from another tiger. Male tigers keep a distance of around 60-100 sq. km and females keep a distance of 20 sq.km while choosing their homes. Both of the sexes protect their own territory. They mark their territory with claw marks, urine and gland secretions on tress. As the number of tigers have declined the attack on humans have declined. Only when a tiger is too old to catch any other prey or is injured they prefer man eating. Other than the famous Bengal tiger there are animals like Elephant, Chital, Nilgai, Sambar Deer, King Cobra, Gharial, Flying Fox, Common Musk Shrew, Hedgehog, Wild Boar, Muntjac and Indian Pangolin. There are also birds of around 600 species. During the winter the variety of birds increases due to migration from countries of East Africa, Europe and Central Asia. Himalayan birds also flock in the area to escape from the snow up in the high ranges of Himalayas. The splendid landscapes and the well-protected areas in the foothills of the Himalayas attract tourists.
