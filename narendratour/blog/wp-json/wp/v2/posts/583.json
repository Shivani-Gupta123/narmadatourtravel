The wildlife reserve was originally part of the Venugopal Wildlife Park. In 1973, it became one of the first reserves under Project Tiger, an Indian Government initiative to project the tiger from extinction. It was renamed the Bandipur National Park in 1974.<\/p>\n<p>Protected under the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, along with the Nagarahole, Mudumalai and Wayanad Sanctuaries, it is one of the country\u2019s best tiger reserves. The sanctuary is located at the foot of the scenic Nilgiri range.<\/p>\n<p>A mix of dry deciduous, evergreen and scrub forests thrive here as does a multitude of flora and fauna. There are many water bodies, hilltops, abandoned temples and villages to break the monotony of the undulating terrain. The Kabini, Nugu and Moyar rivers flow through the Park. Streams like the Bavali, Moolehola, Kekkanalla and Marandi are other replenishment spots for the animals.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8509 alignright\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Bandipur-Wildlife-Sanctuary.jpg\" alt=\"Bandipur Wildlife Sanctuary\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Bandipur is home to large herds of the regal Asian elephant and nearly a hundred majestic tigers. Sighting a tiger is a matter of luck but the more commonly sighted animals include the elephant, Gaur (Indian bison), Chital (spotted deer), Sambar, Dhole (wild dogs), Barking Deer, Langur, Porcupine, Slender Loris, Malabar Squirrels, the Black-napped Hare, the Tiger, Four Horned Antelope, Panther, Sloth Bear, Crocodile, Mouse Deer and Osprey. Reptiles commonly include the Common Rat Snake, Russell\u2019s viper, Common Krait, Indian Python, Flying Snake and Cobra. Many of the species here are endangered ones and protected by law.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Himavad Gopalaswamy Betta<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Himavad means \u201ccovered in clouds\u201d, a name befitting the lush hill which stands proud at a height of 1455 meters. A temple at the hill top, dedicated to Lord Krishna, is a popular stop for trekkers. Catch a dazzling sunset and a panoramic view of distant surroundings from the hilltop. One can occasionally encounter grazing herds of wild elephants.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Moyar Gorge<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The River Moyar winds its way through this area and separates the reserve into the Bandipur and Mudumalai forests in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu respectively. The river cuts the rocky terrain through the 300 meters deep Moyar Gorge. Also famously known as the Mysore Ditch, the gorge is believed to be the only region in Bandipur where the Indian Four Horned Antelope can be sighted.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Safaris<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The plethora of wildlife in these forests can be best enjoyed on a safari ride and is therefore a must do on your Bandipur trip.

Besides, birds like Red Spurfowl, Grey Jungle fowl, Herons, Egrets, Partridge, Quail, Lapwing, Warbles and Green Pigeon can be spotted regularly.<\/p>\n<p>Best time to view wildlife \u2013 May-June and September \u2013 November<\/p>\n<p><strong>Around Bandipur<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nanjangud \u2013 55 km from Bandipur is Nanjangud, a pilgrim centre on the banks of the Kapila River, famous for the massive Nanjundeshwara Temple.
