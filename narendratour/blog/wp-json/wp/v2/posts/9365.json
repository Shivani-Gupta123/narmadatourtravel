So wouldn\u2019t it be utterly unacceptable if every season did not step in with its own distinctive food as well? And when it\u2019s winters that come along with its rich bounty, the variety go gastronomy is only palpable. India is host to way too many people and traditions, innumerable species of veggies and foods and diversive tastes and preferences which finds expression in every season. So it is only natural that there are way too many foods that find particular expression in the country in its winters. Here\u2019s some really exclusive, really authentic Indian winter foods that will make you fall in love with flavours one more time-<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1- Phenni<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9382\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Phenni.jpg\" alt=\"Phenni\" width=\"900\" height=\"556\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Phenni.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Phenni-300x185.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Phenni-768x474.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Phenni-730x450.jpg 730w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A rich Rajasthani dessert exclusive to the winters, fenni or phenni will look to you very much like the colored Seviyan discs that greet you at every corner of the market during the month of Ramzan. And indeed, they are quite close. Phenni is also a disc shaped dessert that is made by deep frying Sewaiyyan or vermicelli in ghee before being soaked in sugary syrup.<\/p>\n<p>However the feni vermicelli is a wheat flour or rice flour based preparation that is made with expertise by confectioners in Jaipur and also in Gujarat. The desi ghee enhanced flavour and the saffron infused color is really a delight to behold during the bleary winter days. Fenni is mixed with hot milk and relished extensively as a super rich sweet treat catering to the quintessential Indian craving for sweetness!<\/p>\n<p>If you are in India during winters you should absolutely not be missing out on a delightful foamy dessert. Dominating the delectable wintry delights in Dilwalo ki Dilli is the famed Daulat ki Chaat- that is indeed a daulat (treasure) of exquisite richness. A melt in your mouth, heart warming, deeply satiating and immensely satisfying treat, the dig into a bowl of Daulat ki Chaat is pure ecstasy!<\/p>\n<p>Raw milk is mixed with cream and left out in the open overnight when the misty dew of the winters work upon the concoction and leaves it in a rich texture. This mixture is then hand churned until it is so light and frothy that it looks like a mass of snowy white cloud! Blended again with sweetened Khoya and served topped with more Khoya, Daulat ki Chaat is an experience you need to live to be enticed by it.<\/p>\n<p>This really heavenly sweet dish is also made in some other parts of the country- as Malaiyyo in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/varanasi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Varanasi<\/a> or nimish in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/lucknow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lucknow<\/a> and I\u2019m not quite sure if I really am doing justice to this sinful preparation by clubbing it together. There might be some difference as far as the authentic versions of each goes but they are more or less the same. Either way winters in India would not be half the enigma it is if not for these utterly divine bowls (that I believe are too small a serving in all their out of the world taste)!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Also Read<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/jaipurs-must-try-foods-more-than-just-compliments\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Top 17 Most Popular Jaipur Foods &amp; Recipes<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>2- Beetroot Thoran<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9367\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Beetroot-Thoran.jpg\" alt=\"Beetroot Thoran\" width=\"900\" height=\"710\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Beetroot-Thoran.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Beetroot-Thoran-300x237.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Beetroot-Thoran-768x606.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Nutritionists might not vouch for you to go so out and about with the sugars especially in winters which are why our next star is a healthy seasonal dish. Beetroot Thoran is a veggie preparation that makes abundant use of the pretty pink veggie that paints the winter food canvas with its bright splash. A traditional Keralian dish that has beetroot cooked with turmeric and chillies, the Thoran is as tasty as it is healthy. Because of its warming and healing properties, turmeric is a wonder spice specially in winters. And combining the right amounts of this zest orange spice with chunks of stir fried beetroot is just the perfect way to dive deep into winter goodness!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3- Nolen Gurer Sandesh<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9380\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Nolen-Gurer-Sandesh.jpg\" alt=\"Nolen Gurer Sandesh\" width=\"900\" height=\"536\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Nolen-Gurer-Sandesh.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Nolen-Gurer-Sandesh-300x179.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Nolen-Gurer-Sandesh-768x457.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Bengalis are known for their artistic expertise in churning out unique Mithais and the Sondesh is one such sweet that is really decadent in taste. But come winters and the already irresistible Sandesh takes on yet another cloak of delicious magic! Nolen Gurer Sandesh is a winter specialty that no one with a sweet tooth should dare miss!<\/p>\n<p>This variation of the already very varied offerings of Sandesh makes use of palm Jaggery or Nolen Gur to deliver the sweet its distinct taste and flavour. Ask any mithai fanatic what they covet more than Sandesh and there\u2019s no way they won\u2019t be blurting out Nolen Gurer Sandesh with a delight that is easily decipherable. With winters almost here, we sure could not be waiting any more to grab some of these tastiest sweetmeats.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4- Ram Ladoo<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9384\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Ram-Ladoo.jpg\" alt=\"Ram Ladoo\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Ram-Ladoo.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Ram-Ladoo-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Ram-Ladoo-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If Ladoos sets you off every time you hear about them because you aren\u2019t one of those blessed ones harbouring a sweet craze, then Ram Ladoo is the thing for you. A popular winter food lining along the  Gaya Bihar streets, these are Moong dal Ladoos that are savoury and are more Chaat like than the Daulat ki Chaat. These crispy fried dal fritters are best served with green chutney and Muli slivers for that quintessential wintry feel. There\u2019s nothing like gobbling up platefuls of these healthy yummies to ward off the  Gaya Bihar chill on a misty, foggy evening!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Suggested to Read<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/famous-indian-food\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Top 20 Tasty and Popular Dishes in India<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>5- Gur ka Halwa<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9370\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Gur-ka-Halwa.jpg\" alt=\"Gur ka Halwa\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Gur-ka-Halwa.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Gur-ka-Halwa-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Gur-ka-Halwa-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Come winters and it\u2019s wise to ditch off your refined sugar and make the switch to Jaggery. Because Gur is known to produce calories it helps keep the body warm and is therefore a healthy and tasty alternative to sugar. No wonder then with the goodness of this ingredient and with the Indian fetish for all things sweet, Gur Ka Halwa needs to be on the typical Indian winter menu.<\/p>\n<p>Gur ka Halwa is as basic as it sounds. The main ingredient here is Jaggery that is liquefied with water and added to a roasted mix of Besan and Suji cooking up a simple dish that is however immensely rich in flavour and texture. Mostly made in the state of Punjab, a steaming hot bowl of this slightly runny Halwa instantly ups your body heat and your spirits to be the perfect winter remedy. There could even be variations like the Atte ka Halwa made with Jaggery that is also as pleasing and appealing to the taste buds.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>6- Undhiyu<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9387\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Undhiyu.jpg\" alt=\"Undhiyu\" width=\"900\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Undhiyu.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Undhiyu-300x196.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Undhiyu-768x502.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>What makes the Gujarati dish Undhiyu a mostly winter preparation is the assortment of seasonal veggies it brings in its fold. Needless to say, it\u2019s a healthy preparation that will sure offset your winter blues. You can make Undhiyu to incorporate a variety of veggies but the basic requirement is fenugreek out of which dumplings are made and a curry is prepared out of it. Traditionally cooked upside down underground in earthen pots fired from above. This almost dry preparation is best savoured as an accompaniment with Puri.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You may also like to read<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/gujarati-cuisine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">11 Delicious Dishes and Food of Gujarat<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>7- Koraishutir Kochuri<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9392\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Koraishutir-Kochuri-1.jpg\" alt=\"Koraishutir Kochuri\" width=\"900\" height=\"611\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Koraishutir-Kochuri-1.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Koraishutir-Kochuri-1-300x204.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Koraishutir-Kochuri-1-768x521.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Koraishutir-Kochuri-1-440x300.jpg 440w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you though Bengal can only have you in with its sweets, then you are naive enough to be denied of its other bites of deliciousness. And one such crispy, snacky winter native is the Koraishutir Kochuri. Just your usual Kochuri but with a spiced peas stuffing, this is the Bengali ode to the prevalent \u2018peas\u2019ey presence of the winters.

But the Gujaratis know how to value their Methi right and so they got them moulded into this eye popping Methi Barfi. It\u2019s a sure diversion from the array of Indian Barfis that line up in Indian sweet shops but isn\u2019t that exactly the beauty of this bitter winter sweet? Because India is a land of unity in diversity, you should indeed seek some unique bliss in this really daring edible venture.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>14- Hanhor Mangxo Komora<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9372\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Hanhor-Mangxo-Komora.jpg\" alt=\"Hanhor Mangxo Komora\" width=\"900\" height=\"704\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Hanhor-Mangxo-Komora.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Hanhor-Mangxo-Komora-300x235.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Hanhor-Mangxo-Komora-768x601.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>How can winters ever be complete with a meat curry to soak up all your chills and blues?

Sticky, sweet and sinful, Lapsi carries the inherent goodness of Daliya and the warmth of Jaggery and is the perfect way to indulge without having to worry about upsetting your body.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>17- Sarson ka Saag<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9385\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Sarson-ka-Saag.jpg\" alt=\"Sarson ka Saag\" width=\"900\" height=\"543\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Sarson-ka-Saag.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Sarson-ka-Saag-300x181.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Sarson-ka-Saag-768x463.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Mustard green preparations- that\u2019s what this exotic sounding dominant winter preparation is in essence. This very famous Punjabi delicacy sure is available all throughout the year and across the country but there\u2019s a special satisfaction that a serving of Sarson da Saag brings about on a chilly winter night. It\u2019s an evergreen dish that is of special importance in winters because it is healthy, spicy, warming, comforting, filling and all things interesting.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>18- Makki di Roti<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9375\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Makki-di-Roti.jpg\" alt=\"Makki di Roti\" width=\"900\" height=\"556\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Makki-di-Roti.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Makki-di-Roti-300x185.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Makki-di-Roti-768x474.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Makki-di-Roti-730x450.jpg 730w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Whip up a serving of this mustard green preparation with Makki di Roti- that is the only authentic way you can do this Indian food justice. This cornflour based flat bread is healthy and can be eaten anyway. But Makke di roti- Sarson ka Saag is a classic Punjabi combo that is the stuff health and taste- and winters- are made of.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>19- Gond Ke Laddu<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9369\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Gond-Ke-Laddu.jpg\" alt=\"Gond Ke Laddu\" width=\"900\" height=\"560\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Gond-Ke-Laddu.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Gond-Ke-Laddu-300x187.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Gond-Ke-Laddu-768x478.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Among the many Ladoos that abound in the sweet Indian scene all times of the year, Gond ke Ladoo is a Hatke addition that makes its advent during the winter months. It is what it says- ball shaped sweets made of Gond and infused with ghee and sugar. A typically Rajasthani sweet cum health pill, you can\u2019t be in India during the winters and not load up your body with more than some couple of boxes of these Ladoos.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>20- Raab<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9383\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Raab.jpg\" alt=\"Raab\" width=\"900\" height=\"559\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Raab.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Raab-300x186.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Raab-768x477.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>A drink that is healthy and helps keep you warm- that\u2019s just the perfect winter antidote after a steaming cup of tea! And the refreshing warmth that a serving of traditional Raab brings to you is one of the many reasons you should be waiting for winter with bated breath. Made basically in the Indian states of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/rajasthan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rajasthan<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/gujarat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gujarat<\/a>, raab is a drink made from bajra or pearl millet flour spiced with dry ginger powder, Ajwain and sweetened with jaggery. While it\u2019s the Bajra base that is particularly healthy, the addition of ghee also does well to add doses of warmth and taste to this uniquely rich preparation.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>21- Moong Dal Halwa<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9379\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Moong-Dal-Halwa-1.jpg\" alt=\"Moong Dal Halwa\" width=\"900\" height=\"558\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Moong-Dal-Halwa-1.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Moong-Dal-Halwa-1-300x186.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Moong-Dal-Halwa-1-768x476.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s sad that a preparation as delicious and tempting as the Moong dal Halwa should be at the mercy of the seasons to satiate our spirits. Of course you can make this dessert all year round but there\u2019s a different aura about a wintry serving of this Halwa. Cooked in generous amounts of ghee, the richness of the ghee complements very well the nuttiness of the roasted dal paste to put forth a blend of exotic aroma and mind blowing flavour on your winter palate.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>22- Matar ka Nimona<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9377\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Matar-ka-Nimona.jpg\" alt=\"Matar ka Nimona\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Matar-ka-Nimona.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Matar-ka-Nimona-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Matar-ka-Nimona-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Because Matar is the veggie that winters inevitably has us heaping on, it\u2019s only worthy that we dish it up every way we can. And a special peas preparation that has the world go round and round is the Nimona. In the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, Matar ka Nimona is a dish that explores the bounty of the Matar in its full glory. A soupy peas curry made with potatoes and a few spices, it is best done up with ghee laced hot rice. Now that sounds like a hot slurpy delight to bring you \u2018pease\u2019 this winter!<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Also Read<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/food-of-uttarakhand.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Traditional Food of Garhwal and Kumaon<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There\u2019s some food for every mood!
