Initially, the government had mentioned that they will be taking necessary steps and provide devotees an option to offer their prayer at the holy cave of Baba Barfani through one rout. However, with an everyday increasing trend in the cases and with no immediate solution, the Yatra was altogether cancelled. This is a move that will keep not only the devotees but also the locals in Jammu and Kashmir safe from potential virus spread. Amaranth Yatra is one of the most pious and holiest of all the pilgrimages undertaken by devout Hindus. So naturally, it came as a huge shock for various Hindu religious leaders, organizations and right-wing political groups as well. The decision was taken through a video conference call conducted by GC Murmu keeping in mind that around 14,600 people in J and K have been infected.<br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Amarnath-Yatra-2020-Cancelled.jpg\" alt=\"Amarnath Yatra 2020 Cancelled\" width=\"700\" height=\"400\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7009\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Amarnath-Yatra-2020-Cancelled.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Amarnath-Yatra-2020-Cancelled-300x171.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Amarnath-Yatra-2020-Cancelled-170x97.jpg 170w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/Amarnath-Yatra-2020-Cancelled-370x211.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><br \/>\nThe spokesman stated, \u201cbased on the current and prevailing circumstances, the board has decided with a heavy heart that it is not suitable or even advisable to hold and conduct this year\u2019s Shri Amarnath Ji Yatra and regret to express its cancellation for 2020.\u201d They also added \u201cthe board is aware of and respects the sentiments of millions of devotees and to keep the religious sentiments alive. The board shall continue to show the live telecast and promote virtual Darshan of the morning and evening Aarti. All the traditions and rituals will be carried out by the temple\u2019s pundits as per the past practices.\u201d Another reason for the cancellation cited by the officials was that the pandemic has already stretched the health administration to its limit and many health care workers and security personnel are also getting infected. The focus right now should primarily be on containing the local transmissions.<\/p>\n<p>Also present in the meeting was the chief secretary BVR Subrahmanyam, SABS\u2019s CEO Bipul Pathal Among other significant board officers. They had come together to discuss the supreme court\u2019s order given on 13th July, wherein the court had left the decision of conducting the Yatra to the state administrative board after a complete assessment of the practical and ground realities, arrangements and how the pandemic may seriously cause a devastating effect on the healthcare system in J and K.<\/p>\n<p>Ever since the beginning of the nationwide lockdown in March all the religious places have been shut down for visit to public. Ever since then the cases in Jammu and Kashmir has continued to spike and go up. However, this is not the first time the Yatra has been cancelled. In 2019, the Yatra was curtailed following the repeated terror threats when the union government had decided to completely nullify articles 370 and 35A. Due to these restrictions were imposed on various daily activities and regional movements.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Also Read:<\/strong> <a href=\"\/blog\/covid-19-mumbai-to- Gaya Bihar-domestic-air-travel-experience\/\">COVID-19 Mumbai to  Gaya Bihar Domestic Air Travel Experience<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Also Read:<\/strong> <a href=\"\/blog\/travelling-after-the-covid-19-pandemic\/\">Travelling After The COVID-19 Pandemic<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Amarnath Yatra Virtual Darshan<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Although the Yatra is cancelled the board of Amaranth shrine has decided to offer continuous morning and evening live telecast of Aarti Darshan so that devotees don\u2019t miss out on the holy experience. people can now witness the blessings of Baba Barfani from the comforts of their homes.
