How often do northern lights happen?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Ans.<\/strong> The northern lights are unpredictable. Their visibility is the surest from late August to early April in regions where there is darkness throughout the day.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Q3. Do northern lights only appear in cold climates?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Ans.<\/strong> It doesn\u2019t have to be too cold to see them, it only has to be very dark to properly witness them. They\u2019re in fact active throughout the year, but people tend to associate auroras with cold because they are only properly visible during the winter months.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Q4. Can I witness auroras for sure in December?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Ans.<\/strong> Typically, December isn\u2019t the best month because famous northern lights destinations like Tromso, Norway, Sweden, and Kiruna receive over 70% of rainfall during that time along with the presence of dark clouds makes it unfavorable for witnessing them.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Q5. Do northern lights make some sound and what do they sound like?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Ans.<\/strong> Aurora borealis is visible due to the magnetic storm. This triggers and discharges certain particles in the inversion layer of the air which creates audible sounds to the audience on the ground. Witnesses have said the sound that the lights make is more like a radio static, faint crackling, light rustling, and even hissing.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Q6. Will I be able to see the northern lights just like in the pictures?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Ans.<\/strong> You may have seen elaborately vibrant colors of the northern lights however, in reality, it is nothing like that. Sometimes you can see and differentiate between colors but for the most part it appears to be a little bit of green on the horizon with come white spikes shooting to the sky. They often appear to be white and kind of like a cloud.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Q7. Why are northern lights green?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Ans.<\/strong> Green is the most commonly seen color in the Borealis. The reason being, when the solar wind hits millions of oxygen atoms for a little while and then decays back to their original state creating a green hue that we get to see.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Q8. How far south are northern lights visible?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Ans.<\/strong> Northern lights are a frequent sight in the far northern latitudes of the earth. The most they can see is as far as 35 degrees north latitude from the south.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Q9. Where are auroras most commonly seen on earth?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Ans.<\/strong> The best places to see the auroras are near the magnetic poles. These regions include northern Greenland, the Scandinavian coast, Siberia, Alaska in the north, and Antarctica in the south.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Q10. How fast do the northern lights move?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Ans.<\/strong> Northern lights solar particles move millions of miles per hour.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Witnessing the northern lights is a soul-stirring experience.
