Bheem (one of the Pandava brothers) found him then to hide himself Lord Shiva dived into the ground and Bheem could only get hold of the bull\u2019s hump. So, at Kedarnath Lord Shiva is being worshipped as a bull hump since then only.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Places to Visit In and Around Kedarnath<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There are numerous places to visit in and around Kedarnath and most of the sightseeing locations have mythological and religious implications.
