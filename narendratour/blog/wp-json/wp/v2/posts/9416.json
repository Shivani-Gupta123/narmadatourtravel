Let\u2019s take a look at some of these less famous world heritage sites that further amp up the heritage and beauty of India-<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Chandigarh Capitol Complex<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: Chandigarh, designed by architect Le Corbusier.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Significance<\/strong>: Represents modern architecture and urban planning.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Key Features<\/strong>: Includes the Assembly Building, Secretariat, and High Court; noted for its open spaces and sculptures.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cultural Importance<\/strong>: A symbol of India\u2019s post-independence architectural identity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9419\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Chandigarh-Capitol-Complex.jpg\" alt=\"Chandigarh Capitol Complex\" width=\"900\" height=\"552\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Chandigarh-Capitol-Complex.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Chandigarh-Capitol-Complex-300x184.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Chandigarh-Capitol-Complex-768x471.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Diversive than any of the other World Heritage Sites India boasts of is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/chandigarh-tourism\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chandigarh<\/a> Capitol Complex which is an architectural phenomenon in itself. A very spectacular work of art by French architect Le Corbusier, the historic Chandigarh Capitol Complex houses also quite an unlikely premise. Encompassing the sober confines of the state Secretariat, the High Court and the Legislative Assembly, the Capitol Complex however comes alive in an aesthetic grandeur quite rare to such institutions of importance.<\/p>\n<p>The magnificent edifices housed by the complex sits majestically against the backdrop of the stunning Shivalik peaks as a distinguished UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2016. A part of The Architectural Work of Le Corbusier, an Outstanding Contribution to the Modern Movement, the Capitol Complex also features the popular Open Hand Monument, Geometric Hill and Tower of Shadows besides the three buildings and a lake. In its striking aesthetics and standout presence, the Chandigarh Capitol Complex undoubtedly marks the very identity of the city it defines.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Mountain Railways of India<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: Includes three railways: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/darjeeling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Darjeeling<\/a> Himalayan Railway, Nilgiri Mountain Railway, and Kalka-Shimla Railway.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Significance<\/strong>: Showcases engineering marvels in hilly terrain and the picturesque landscapes of the mountains.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Key Features<\/strong>: Narrow gauge railways, stunning views, and historical significance dating back to the British colonial era.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cultural Importance<\/strong>: An iconic travel experience that reflects India\u2019s rich railway heritage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9423\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Mountain-Railways-of-India.jpg\" alt=\"Mountain Railways of India\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Mountain-Railways-of-India.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Mountain-Railways-of-India-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Mountain-Railways-of-India-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The allure of the hills and the quaint charm of the winding rail lines that make their way along the lush greenery- a mountainous rail experience in India is a bliss divine. And while the aesthetics might not be the absolute criteria for the Mountain Railways of India to be a prominent UNESCO World Heritage Site, it also is the mesmerising beauty and natural splendor that makes these collection of railways a truly prime attraction of the country.<\/p>\n<p>Comprising the designated sites Darjeeling Himalayan Railways in West Bengal,Nilgiri Mountain Railways in Tamil Nadu and Kalka Shimla Railways in Himachal Pradesh, India\u2019s mountain railways are a wonder unparalleled. With the bestowment of the heritage status on these tracks in 1999,2005 and 2008 respectively, the mountain railways stand testimony as \u201coutstanding examples of bold, ingenious engineering solutions for the problem of establishing an effective rail link through rugged, mountainous terrain.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It helps also that each of the railway lines has its own distinctive claims to fame. The Darjeeling Himalayan Railways sits pretty in its ambient presence. Trailing through the dewy green expanses of the hill station town, the railway is a hit with tourists who amble along on a joyous ride aboard the cheerful Toy Train. Also notable for its many peculiar signages that spell out names like Agony Point and Sensation Corner, the railway is remarkable as well in its many spirals on steep hills providing scenic views of the valleys below.<\/p>\n<p>The Kalka Shimla Railways however have somewhat of an uncanny aura. The longest tunnel on the route and in fact one that sits pretty in a seemingly mysterious locale is the Tunnel No.33 which is believed to harbour considerable paranormal presence. In its spooky essence as being among the haunted places in India, this heritage site sure also entices with a thrill of its own!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Rani ki Vav<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: Patan, Gujarat.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Significance<\/strong>: A stepwell built in the 11th century, known for its intricate carvings and architecture.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Key Features<\/strong>: Seven levels of stairs adorned with sculptures of deities, apsaras (celestial maidens), and motifs.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cultural Importance<\/strong>: Reflects the water management practices of ancient India and showcases the artistic skills of the time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9424\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Rani-ki-Vav.jpg\" alt=\"Rani ki Vav\" width=\"900\" height=\"547\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Rani-ki-Vav.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Rani-ki-Vav-300x182.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Rani-ki-Vav-768x467.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Famous for its Patola sarees which are some of the most exquisite types of silk Sarees is the town of Patan in Gujarat which also plays host to as exquisite a World Heritage Site.

As a monument that was built by queen Udayamati in memory of her husband, the Rani ki Vav is almost parallel to the Taj Mahal in stature. Though in popular culture, the 2016 Cleanest Iconic Place has been a rather ephemeral figment of public memory.<\/p>\n<p>Considered one of the finest and largest of its kind, the stepwell is also declared a monument of national importance. Significant also in its inverted temple design that supposedly highlights the sanctity of water, the stepwell is divided into seven levels of stairs with sculptural panels that combine religious, mythological and secular imagery.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Also Read<\/strong>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/stepwells-in-gujarat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Most Famous Stepwells in Gujarat<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Khangchendzonga National Park<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong>: Sikkim.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Significance<\/strong>: Home to the third highest peak in the world, Khangchendzonga.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Key Features<\/strong>: Rich biodiversity, glaciers, and diverse ecosystems, including alpine meadows and rhododendron forests.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Cultural Importance<\/strong>: Holds spiritual significance for local communities and is a biodiversity hotspot.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9421\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Khangchendzonga-National-Park.jpg\" alt=\"Khangchendzonga National Park\" width=\"900\" height=\"577\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Khangchendzonga-National-Park.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Khangchendzonga-National-Park-300x192.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Khangchendzonga-National-Park-768x492.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The first mixed heritage site of India, the Khangchendzonga National Park is a really spectacular abode of natural treasure.
