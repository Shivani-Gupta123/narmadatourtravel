Kochi was an important spice trading centre on the Arabian Sea coast since the 14th century. Kochi became the first European colonial settlement in India following the Portuguese occupation in 1503. Kochi was the capital of Portuguese India till 1530 when the latter decided to shift it to Goa. Kochi hosted the grave of Vasco da Gama, the famous European explorer to have set sail for India and was buried at St. Francis Church until his remains were returned to Portugal in 1539. Kochi was subsequently occupied by the Dutch and the British as well as the rulers of Mysore. The hereditary premiership of Kochi held by the Paliath Achan also concluded during this period. By the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814, Kochi was ceded to the Britishers in lieu of the Bangka Island. In 1866, Fort Kochi became a municipality and in 1896, the ruler of Cochin, subservient to the British, initiated local administration. In 1947, when India gained independence from, Cochin joined the Indian Union.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Possible source of the origin of the name \u2018Kochi\u2019<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some say it has evolved from the Malayalam term \u2018Koch Azhi\u2019, meaning \u2018small lagoon\u2019.<\/li>\n<li>Some indicate the name to have come from the Sanskrit word \u2018Go shree\u2019 which means \u2018prosperous with cows\u2019.<\/li>\n<li>A third source says the name has come from the term \u2018Kaci\u2019, which means \u2018harbour\u2019<\/li>\n<li>Many European accounts say the name Kochi has evolved after the \u2018Kochchi\u2019 river.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Geography<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Kochi city is bordered by the Western Ghats mountain range in the east and the Arabian Sea in the west.
