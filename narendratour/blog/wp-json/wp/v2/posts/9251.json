He was guided by Yogi Gorakhnath to reach Rishi Agastya and obtain Diksha.<\/p>\n<p>Babaji was drawn to spirituality at an early age and stood out from his fellow children.

He encountered numerous sages and began practicing thorough meditation under their guidance. He became proficient in Kriya Yoga with practice and commitment. During Kriya Yoga, a person develops their spirituality and gains control over their body and mind. He accomplished something that very few individuals in this world can do in their lifetime.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Fascinating Facts about Babaji<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>According to certain fables, Mahavatar Babaji is continuing to live for centuries. Some stories claim that someone saw Babaji for the first time 2000 years ago. Only a handful of individuals have laid eyes on him, and all of them characterized him as being in the 18\u201325 age range. He is also referred to as Amar Baba or the Deathless Guru because it is thought that he has overcome death.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9256\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/Rajinikanth-Visit-Babaji-caves-in-Uttarakhand.jpg\" alt=\"Rajinikanth Visit Babaji caves in Uttarakhand\" width=\"900\" height=\"564\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/Rajinikanth-Visit-Babaji-caves-in-Uttarakhand.jpg 900w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/Rajinikanth-Visit-Babaji-caves-in-Uttarakhand-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/Rajinikanth-Visit-Babaji-caves-in-Uttarakhand-768x481.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>He used to mentor a select group of disciples, among them Lahiri Mahasaya, who in turn taught Swami Sri Yukteswar and Paramahansa Yogananda the lessons that Babaji had imparted to him.<\/p>\n<p>In his Autobiography of a Yogi, Swami Paramhans Yoganand dedicated a chapter to Mahavatar Babaji, disclosing his teachings and way of life. And such is the way Mahavatar Babaji is known to and followed by people.<\/p>\n<p>He stated in this autobiography that Babaji has given Yoga initiated to Shankara, an ancient founder of Swami Order and also to Saint Kabir, the medieval poet. He also states, \u201cMahavatar Babaji can be seen or recognized by others when he desires so. He is known to have appeared in many slightly different forms to various devotees, sometimes without beard and mustache and sometimes with them. As his undecaying body requires no food, the master seldom eats.

Everyday pilgrims visit the cave to experience the ultimate spiritual existence of their own self.<\/p>\n<p>Mahavatar Babaji&#8217;s impact has sparked a number of spiritual movements, such as the Yoga Satsanga Society and The Self Realization Fellowship (SRF), which were established by Paramahansa Yogananda to propagate Babaji&#8217;s teachings globally.<\/p>\n<p>Babaji is known for his silence. He has mastered his mind and consciousness in such a way that he communicate telepathically or using impactful few words statements.<\/p>\n<p>Legend has it that Babaji has achieved the Saurabh Samadhi which means he has become immortal and has the power to change his appearance whenever he pleases. He is said to be a youthful, attractive man with long hair, a luminous complexion, and eyes that are full of wisdom.<\/p>\n<p>Many people also think that he is a heavenly incarnation who came to earth to share his teachings and impart Kriya Yoga as a means of spiritual enlightenment.<\/p>\n<p>Although much about Mahavatar Babaji remains mysterious, he continues to inspire the people all around the world through his teachings and guidance.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How to Reach Mahavatar Babaji Cave<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Babaji\u2019s cave is located in Kukuchina near Dwarahat.
