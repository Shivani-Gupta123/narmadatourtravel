The diversity of culture and linguistic plus regional diversity also reflects itself in the diversity of nature as well as in the geographical diversity.

If you are passionate about traveling, you would love to explore the various travel destinations of India; not only the popular ones but also the rare, less known, rather hidden ones which still retain the wildness and pristine beauty of pure nature.

Well, this list will stun you and give you a whole new box of hidden wonders that are sure to have you packing your bags real soon\u2026<\/p>\n<p><strong>01. Majuli<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1060\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/majuli-island.jpg\" alt=\"Majuli Island\" width=\"700\" height=\"356\" \/><br \/>\n<strong>State: Assam<\/strong><br \/>\nBecause of the lack of political stability and lack of tourist infrastructure there is a dearth of tourist traffic to the picture perfect state of Assam. Many travel magazines have unofficially declared Assam as the natural beauty capital of India and Majuli is the leading example of this. There is almost zero pollution here and the air is fresh and invigorating. This is the perfect place to go for a change of scenery or to recuperate from an illness as its serene and unbelievable lovely. The place Majuli is considered to be the biggest River Island in the world and so has been officially declared by UNESCO as a world heritage site.<\/p>\n<p><strong>02. Tarkarli Beach<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1061\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Tarkarli.jpg\" alt=\"Tarkarli Beach\" width=\"700\" height=\"311\" \/><br \/>\n<strong>State: Maharashtra<\/strong><br \/>\nJust a few hours away from the hustle bustle of India\u2019s busiest metropolis Mumbai lies a perfect piece of heaven called Tarkarli Beach. It\u2019s surprising to see the slow trickle of visitors to this beach as it undoubtedly possesses all the things tourists look for when they visit a beach. The pristine blue water, clean tan colored sandy stretches and lines of palm trees make Tarkarli look like a calmer version of the famous Kovalam beach of Kerala. Tarkarli offers a lot to the adventure lover as scuba diving and snorkeling activities are on here in full force. This is an ideal place to go if you love to hear the whisper of the waves and see the unlettered stretches of sandy bay only dotted with precious sea shells.<\/p>\n<p><strong>03. Lepchaghat<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1062\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Lepchaghat.jpg\" alt=\"Lepchaghat\" width=\"700\" height=\"349\" \/><br \/>\n<strong>State: West Bengal<\/strong><br \/>\nLepchaghat lies very close to Darjeeling which is one of the busiest tourist destinations in West Bengal. The small intimate hamlet of Lepchaghat has a magical mystical feel to it as it\u2019s surrounded by all sides by thick oak trees. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately) it avoids noisome tourist traffic because most of it is diverted to Darjeeling. The amazing flora and fauna of the place has helped Lepchaghat is securing the interest and attention of leading naturalists, ornithologists and botanists and this place has featured prominently in many travel magazines.<\/p>\n<p><strong>04. Tawang<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1256\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Tawang-Monastery.jpg\" alt=\"Tawang Monastery\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" \/><br \/>\n<strong>State: Arunachal Pradesh<\/strong><br \/>\nArunachal Pradesh is known as the prettiest of the seven sisters of the north east and Tawang is one of the finest examples of its breathtaking natural beauty. Reaching Tawang is no mean feats it will require the traveler to battle out the harsh unforgiving weather and weather the risk of frequently occurring landslides. However Tawang holds a lot of mystique as its home to the ancient 400 year old Tawang Monastery. The landscape is virgin, pristine and offers a lot of promise to rock climbing enthusiasts. Tawang is unfishable for its panoramic views but yet remains unexplored by the tourist traffic of India.<\/p>\n<p><strong>05. Wayanad<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6205\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Wayanad.jpg\" alt=\"Wayanad\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Wayanad.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Wayanad-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Wayanad-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Wayanad-147x110.jpg 147w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Wayanad-333x250.jpg 333w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Wayanad-725x544.jpg 725w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><br \/>\n<strong>State: Kerala<\/strong><br \/>\nIf you are completely stressed out from the demands of the big city life, then head off to Kerala for getting your much needed shot of tranquility.

Unakoti has a rich and detailed history in Hindu Mythology and yet it\u2019s surprising to see that this place remains so underrated. Legend says that Shiva was travelling to Kashi with more than hundred thousands of Gods and Goddesses. Shiva made a night halt at Unakoti and asked everybody to wake up before sunrise. However no one woke up which angered Shiva so much that he cursed everybody to become stone images while he set off on his own. Unakoti has marvelous stone carving of Hindu Mythology and these represent an amazing feat of artistry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>07. Kasar Devi or the Crank\u2019s Ridge<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1068\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Kasar-Devi-Temple.jpg\" alt=\"Kasar Devi Temple\" width=\"700\" height=\"416\" \/><br \/>\n<strong>State: Uttarakhand<\/strong><br \/>\nVisit Kasar Devi not for religious symbolism as the name suggests but for a taste of the full bodied hippie way of life. The same atmosphere which draws huge number of tourists to Old Manali reigns in Kesar Devi or Crank\u2019s Ridge albeit on a milder and less noisy scale. There is also a hill here called the Hippie Hill which has fully fledged trance music playing on here all the time while the shops sell regular hippie wear at throwaway prices. Bob Dylan and Allen Ginsberg used to frequent this place during their heydays and at the peak of the Hippie movement in India.<\/p>\n<p><strong>08. Keibul Lamjao<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1070\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Keibul-Lamjao.jpg\" alt=\"Keibul Lamjao\" width=\"700\" height=\"384\" \/><br \/>\n<strong>State: Manipur<\/strong><br \/>\nAnother illustrious member of the Seven Sisters of the North East is Manipur which contains a lot of gems for the truly adventurous traveler.
