There are myriads of legends associated with the origin of the holy abodes of Devbhoomi which are related to an array of five holy temples of Lord Shiva collectively called as Panch Kedar. This set of Lord Shiva temple includes Tungnath, Kedarnath, Rudranath, Madhyamaheshwar and Kalpeshwar. All these revered and heavily visited shrines are beautifully located in the Garhwal Himalayan Ranges whose origins are mostly associated with the Pandavas of Mahabharata. Each of the temples is popular for its amazing location and the tranquil ambiance. However, it is not very easy to reach these holy shrines as there is no motorable or straight road going to the destinations. The splendid journey of Panch Kedar (it generally takes 15-16 days to complete this spiritual journey) gives you a lifelong memorable journey experience. Snow-clad mountains, lush green meadows, imposing and magnificent mountain peaks, wildlife, and enchanting water streams add more glory to the spiritual and tranquil significance of this journey. This entire sacred journey is stretched up to 170 km commencing from Rishikesh in the order: Kedarnath, Tungnath, Rudranath, Madhyamaheshwar, and Kalpeshwar.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Legends behind the Origin of Panch Kedar<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Similar to other pilgrimage places, Panch Kedar also has numerous legends associated with its origin. One of the most popular is taken from the Mahabharata era. The legend states that Pandavas were heavily burdened with the guilt of fratricide. To seek blessings from Lord Shiva and to please him for that they performed atonement but Lord Shiva didn\u2019t want to absolve their sins so easily. To hide from Pandavas he disguised himself in a bull at Guptkashi. Pandavas came searching for him and reached in the Garhwal Himalayan Ranges. Bheema (one of the mighty Pandava brothers) recognized lord Shiva and tried to catch the bull then Lord Shiva as a bull dived into the ground and disappeared. Lord Shiva then reappeared in the Garhwal Himalayan Range in different parts at different places. His hump was discovered at Kedarnath, navel at Madhyamaheshwar, face at Rudranath, arms at Tungnath, and hair at Kalpeshwar. Since then, he has been worshipped differently at different spots of Panch Kedar.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Kedarnath Temple<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Kedarnath-Temple.jpg\" alt=\"Kedarnath Temple\" width=\"700\" height=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7849\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Kedarnath-Temple.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/Kedarnath-Temple-300x214.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><br \/>\nLocated in a picturesque landscape studded with beautiful mountains, snow-covered peaks, lush green valleys, and dense forests, Kedarnath is considered one of the most important and the sacred shrine of Panch Kedar. The temple is nestled at an elevation of 3584 meters above the sea level in the Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand. It is also considered as one of the prime destinations in Chota Char Yatra in Uttarakhand. The temple has a cone-shaped lingam resembling the hump of Lord Shiva. The present temple of Kedarnath is believed to be established by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th-9th century AD. Gaurikund is the nearest motorable road leading towards Kedarnath. Rest of the distance (around 14 km trekking trail) is covered through trekking on steep slopes, however, the panoramic views of the trail negotiate the tedious trekking experience and transform it in an enjoying and enthralling experience. Due to heavy snowfalls, the temple is closed from November to April and gets opened in April last.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Places to Visit<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>There are many nearby attractions located in Kedarnath Dham region including Gaurikund, Chorabari Tal, Bhairav Temple, and Vasuki Temple. Gaurikund is the base of the trekking trail to Kedarnath and houses an ancient Gauri Temple. Also called as Gandhi Sarovar, Chorabari Tal is believed that some of the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi were submerged in this water body. Also called as the protection of Kedarnath during winter, Bhairav Temple is believed to be constructed around 1000 years back.

The temple is situated at a great altitude of 3680 meters above sea level. The pilgrimage is dedicated to Lord Shiva where devotees pay their offering an homage to the hands of Lord Shiva. According to Hindu mythology, Adi Shankaracharya discovered this temple around more than 1000 years back. Due to its high altitude location similar to other temples in Uttarakhand, you need to cover a certain trekking distance to reach the shrine. However, the trekking is quite easy at some places but it becomes a bit difficult when you reach towards the Chandrashila Peak. The panoramic views and the beautiful landscapes take away all your tiredness and give an amazing and enthralling trekking experience. As like other high altitude temples of Uttarakhand, Tungnath is also closed during the winter season and is only touched by adventure enthusiasts in this season.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Places to Visit<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Despite being a religious destination, Tungnath is equally visited by nature lovers, adventure enthusiasts, and peace seekers.

Kalpeshwar is the last Shiva Temple to be visited in Panch Kedar array which is situated at an elevation of 2200 meters above the sea level and in the picturesque town of Chamoli district.
