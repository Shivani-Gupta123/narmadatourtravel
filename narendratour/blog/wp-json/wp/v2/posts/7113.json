In India, the Himalayan range is host to a number of glaciers, source to the majority of the river network that irrigates and sustains the great northern plains. In India, many glaciers and the rivers emanating therefrom are considered sacred, specially in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/uttarakhand\"><strong>state of Uttarakhand<\/strong><\/a>, often referred to as Devbhumi or the land of the Gods. Glaciers also provide a huge source of tourism, both for religious devotees or simple adventure seekers.

Located on the Kalind Mountain on the southwestern slopes of Bandarpoonch peaks at a height of 4421 metres, the glacier is extremely difficult to access, and as such devotees of tourists are not generally allowed to trek up to the actual glacier.<\/p>\n<p>The trek is a beautiful one, with snow-clad mountains surrounding the path as it crosses through dense forests laden with snow, captivating streams and gorgeous lakes.
