From far, these fields may seem like colorful strips but as you get closer the fully bloomed tulips covering the strips of land displaying various whimsical colors will truly blow your mind. The cool long spring season that lasts from mid-march to the end of May, makes it the perfect condition for Tulips to thrive in the Netherlands. Not just that the soil is continuously drained to make it more aerated which adds to the perfect tulip growing conditions in this part of the world.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Tunnel of Love, Ukraine<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7377\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Tunnel-of-Love-Ukraine.jpg\" alt=\"Tunnel of Love, Ukraine\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Tunnel-of-Love-Ukraine.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Tunnel-of-Love-Ukraine-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Tunnel-of-Love-Ukraine-170x110.jpg 170w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Tunnel-of-Love-Ukraine-370x238.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><br \/>\nUnlike its name, the tunnel of love is an industrial section of railway which is located near the town of Klevan in Ukraine. The standout feature of this railway line which also makes it one of the most pictured places on Social Media is the lush green arches. Running at the length of 3 to 5 km this place is also one of the favorites among locals and tourists to take soulful walks. The entire line of this railway line is blessed and bounded by thick forest cover and the green tunnel that stretches from 3 to just a little over 4 km making it look like a secret track to a fairytale world.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Salar De Uyuni, Bolivia<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7373\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Salar-De-Uyuni-Bolivia.jpg\" alt=\"Salar De Uyuni, Bolivia\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Salar-De-Uyuni-Bolivia.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Salar-De-Uyuni-Bolivia-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Salar-De-Uyuni-Bolivia-170x110.jpg 170w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Salar-De-Uyuni-Bolivia-370x238.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><br \/>\nSpread out over an astounding area of over 10,000 sq. km. Salar De Uyuni is the world\u2019s largest salt flat. Located close to the crest of the Andes on an elevation of over 12,000 feet above sea level, the Salar was formed as a result of transformations between numerous prehistoric lakes. The extraordinary flatness of the Salar\u2019s crust serves as a rich source of salt as well as covers a pool of brine that shows extraordinary Lithium content. The Salar is also a major transportation route across the Bolivian Altiplano along with being a prime breeding ground for flamingoes.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. Hitachi Seaside Park, Japan<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7369\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Hitachi-Seaside-Park-Japan.jpg\" alt=\"Hitachi Seaside Park, Japan\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Hitachi-Seaside-Park-Japan.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Hitachi-Seaside-Park-Japan-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Hitachi-Seaside-Park-Japan-170x110.jpg 170w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Hitachi-Seaside-Park-Japan-370x238.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><br \/>\nSpread out over 350 hectares, Hitachi Seaside Park is a spacious park located close to Mito in the Ibaraki prefecture and features a huge variety of flowers and other blossoms that will definitely take your breath away. The park also features scenic cycling and walking trail along with a fun amusement park which will give you a whole new perspective to viewing the park. Mimicking the color of the sky, the park\u2019s iconic flower, the blue Nemophila, completely covers the Miharashi Hills from late April to mid-may. The Criss-crossing paths give spectacular views of the Pacific Ocean and the park. By the fall months, the hills get covered entirely in green Kokia bushes that turn red as the weather changes to cooler conditions.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5. Slope Point, New Zealand<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7374\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Slope-Point-New-Zealand.jpg\" alt=\"Slope Point, New Zealand\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Slope-Point-New-Zealand.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Slope-Point-New-Zealand-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Slope-Point-New-Zealand-170x110.jpg 170w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Slope-Point-New-Zealand-370x238.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><br \/>\nThe slope point marks the southernmost point of the south island of New Zealand. The eroded cliffs of this point, which does not have any habitation around and the land is used as a grazing ground for sheep, dip down into the sea making the whole place look extremely dramatic. But what is surreal about this place is the formation of trees here. The cold winds that constantly tear their way through the trees here give them the shape of being permanently slanted towards the direction of the wind. The winds are so harsh and whipping that the trees here are left looking mangled and very gothic in a way.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>6. Tianzi Mountains, China<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7375\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Tianzi-Mountains-China.jpg\" alt=\"Tianzi Mountains, China\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Tianzi-Mountains-China.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Tianzi-Mountains-China-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Tianzi-Mountains-China-170x110.jpg 170w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Tianzi-Mountains-China-370x238.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><br \/>\nLocated in the Hunan province of China, and very close to Suoxi Valley in south-central China, Tianzi Mountain is one of the most unreal-looking places on earth. The mountain is named after the early Ming dynasty of China and is also a part of the Wulingyuan scenic area which was also included under the UNESCO world heritage site in 1992. These mountains that look like massive stone pillars are quartz sandstone that is believed to have been formed naturally about 400 years ago. The mountains look surreal since they are thin, irregular, and rise high above the ground.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>7. Emerald Ice, Russia<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7365\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Emerald-Ice-Russia.jpg\" alt=\"Emerald Ice, Russia\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Emerald-Ice-Russia.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Emerald-Ice-Russia-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Emerald-Ice-Russia-170x110.jpg 170w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Emerald-Ice-Russia-370x238.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><br \/>\nThe emerald ice is a natural phenomenon that occurs for a limited time during the winter months and it is another one of the most photographed natural wonders in the world. This natural wonder occurs in Lake Baikal which is situated in eastern Siberia, Russia. Not only is the lake known for being one of the oldest lakes in the world as it dates back to over 20 million years ago but it is also one of the largest and deepest lakes in the world. During the peak winter months, for about 5 months, when the lake freezes over, the ice crust on the lake cracks which look like emerald stone jutting out of the lake.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>8. Giant\u2019s Causeway, Northern Ireland<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7366\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Giants-Causeway-Northern-Ireland.jpg\" alt=\"Giant\u2019s Causeway, Northern Ireland\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Giants-Causeway-Northern-Ireland.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Giants-Causeway-Northern-Ireland-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Giants-Causeway-Northern-Ireland-170x110.jpg 170w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Giants-Causeway-Northern-Ireland-370x238.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><br \/>\nGiant\u2019s Causeway is a UNESCO world heritage site and a natural reserve that is unlike any other natural rock formation in the world. Spread out over an area of 40,000 interlocking basalt columns, these unnaturally natural formations are a result of the ancient volcanic fissure eruption. In the UK the causeway is also ranked as the 4th greatest natural wonder in the UK. The tops of these formations form stepping stones that lead visitors from the top of the cliff down to the sea. Most of the steps are hexagonal in shape although some other rocks have even 8 sharp sides and edges that make them look like they have been constructed by humans.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>9. Glowing Beach, Maldives<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7367\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Glowing-Beach-Maldives.jpg\" alt=\"Glowing Beach, Maldives\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Glowing-Beach-Maldives.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Glowing-Beach-Maldives-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Glowing-Beach-Maldives-170x110.jpg 170w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Glowing-Beach-Maldives-370x238.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><br \/>\nSituated in Mudhdhoo Island which is also known as Vaadhoo Island, this unique island is known for its glowing waves that wash over its shores. This natural phenomenon happens due to the presence of millions of bioluminescent microorganisms known as phytoplankton that give the waves fluorescent lighting that looks too surreal to believe. As the sky gets darker these self-illuminating microbes emit a bright light which gives these waves an ethereal effect. June to October is the best time to catch these glowing waves in full glory when the sea temperature remains comparatively warmer as compared to any other month and the possibility of witnessing these glowing waves multiplies tenfold.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>10. Lake Retba, Senegal<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7179\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Lake-Hillier-Australia.jpg\" alt=\"Lake Hillier, Australia\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Lake-Hillier-Australia.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Lake-Hillier-Australia-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Lake-Hillier-Australia-170x110.jpg 170w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/Lake-Hillier-Australia-370x238.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><br \/>\nLake Retba or lac rose is named after the natural pink waters that this lake holds. Separated by the Atlantic sea by a very narrow corridor of dunes, the pinkness of the lake is due to the presence of incredibly high salt content in it which occurs due to the extreme ingress of the seawater and quick evaporation process. Lake Retba is also under consideration for becoming a UNESCO world heritage site. Situated at a distance of 30 km from the city center of Dakar you can even buy local, pure, African Salt as a souvenir for yourself and your friends back home.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>11. Hang Son Doong, Vietnam<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7368\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Hang-Son-Doong-Vietnam.jpg\" alt=\"Hang Son Doong, Vietnam\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Hang-Son-Doong-Vietnam.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Hang-Son-Doong-Vietnam-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Hang-Son-Doong-Vietnam-170x110.jpg 170w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Hang-Son-Doong-Vietnam-370x238.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><br \/>\nHang son Doong in Vietnam is famous for being one of the largest natural caves in the world. Located very close to the Laos-Vietnam border, this unbelievable cave has a fast-flowing subterranean river running through it and it is also the largest natural cave passage in the world by volume. The name of the cave literally translates into \u2018cave of the mountain river\u2019. The cave is made out of limestone solution and is believed to be anywhere between 2 to 5 million years ago. The cave also contains some of the world\u2019s largest and tallest stalagmite formations that can go upto as high as over 70 meters.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>12. Antelope Canyon, USA<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7362\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Antelope-Canyon-USA.jpg\" alt=\"Antelope Canyon, USA\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Antelope-Canyon-USA.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Antelope-Canyon-USA-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Antelope-Canyon-USA-170x110.jpg 170w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Antelope-Canyon-USA-370x238.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><br \/>\nAntelope Canyon is a slot canyon located in northern Arizona. The geological formation here looks like a monumental sandstone sculpture and less than a natural geological formation. Every photographer\u2019s dream, the canyon\u2019s walls look uniquely like waves of sandstone washed up against the walls. The light beams pouring in through the crevasses and arches while lighting up different bends is a wonderful natural phenomenon that is rarely found anywhere in the world. The canyon is a result of constant water erosion that went on for millions of years before the water was naturally emptied.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>13. Mount Roraima, Venezuela<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7370\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Mount-Roraima-Venezuela.jpg\" alt=\"Mount Roraima, Venezuela\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Mount-Roraima-Venezuela.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Mount-Roraima-Venezuela-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Mount-Roraima-Venezuela-170x110.jpg 170w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Mount-Roraima-Venezuela-370x238.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><br \/>\nMount Roraima is known for being one of the oldest mountains on the planet. The mountain is bounded by high cliffs that rise up to a height of over 1,300 feet and can only be scaled by professional climbers. Also known as the lost world\u2019s tabletop. Mount Roraima towers over and overlooks the thick, lush and intense forest cover below. This natural rock formation shares its borders with places like Venezuela, Brazil, and Guyana and can be seen standing out from the rest of the natural surroundings. The unique rock formation is also home to some flora and fauna collections that cannot be found anywhere on the planet.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>14. Petra, Jordan<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7372\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Petra-Jordan.jpg\" alt=\"Petra, Jordan\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Petra-Jordan.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Petra-Jordan-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Petra-Jordan-170x110.jpg 170w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Petra-Jordan-370x238.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><br \/>\nPetra is a historical and archaeological city situated in south Jordan. Sitting majestically amidst the barren red desert Petra is an archaeological wonder that will leave you stunned. The site dates back to over 300 BC when it had served as the capital for the Nabatean kingdom. Petra is visited through a very narrow canyon and it contains tombs and temples that are carved artistically and intricately into the pink sandstone cliffs which have also earned it the name of &#8220;Rose City&#8221;. The most standout feature of the whole site is the presence of a 45 meter high Al Khazneh, a temple with an ornate, Greek-style facade. A must-visit for people who get enticed by history, otherworldly wonders, and architecture or design enthusiasts.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>15. Black Forest, Germany<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7364\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Black-Forest-Germany.jpg\" alt=\"Black Forest, Germany\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Black-Forest-Germany.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Black-Forest-Germany-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Black-Forest-Germany-170x110.jpg 170w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Black-Forest-Germany-370x238.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><br \/>\nBlack forest is a mountainous terrain that is located at an elevation of about 500 to 1,500 meters above sea level. Historically, the area around the forest was an important center of mining ore deposits which was later on destroyed by the police during the 17th century. The dense evergreen forest and picturesque village are regularly mentioned in the popular fairytale books written by the Brothers Grimm. The density of the forest is responsible for its name since it remains bound by a thick forest of evergreen nature. The region is extremely famous for cuckoo clocks, watchmaking, and tourism activities throughout the year.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>16. Naica Mine, Mexico<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7371\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Naica-Mine-Mexico.jpg\" alt=\"Naica Mine, Mexico\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Naica-Mine-Mexico.jpg 700w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Naica-Mine-Mexico-300x193.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Naica-Mine-Mexico-170x110.jpg 170w, https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Naica-Mine-Mexico-370x238.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" \/><br \/>\nNaica mine is located in the state of Chihuahua in Mexico and is known for the mining of zinc, silver, and lead. Due to its massive size and capacity, it is famous for being the world\u2019s largest producer of silver. The most awe-inspiring feature of the mine is the cave of the crystals which is approximately located about 1,000 feet below the surface in the limestone host rock of the mine.
