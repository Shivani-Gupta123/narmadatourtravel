One of the ninety Minority Concentrated Districts of India, Lucknow is famous for its architecture, gardens, music, poetry and cuisines. It is a popular subject of study for the keen students of history and culture. Lucknow is the second largest city of Uttar Pradesh after Kanpur and is a fast-growing metro city in India.<\/p>\n<p>Lucknow historically has been a learning centre in Hindi and Urdu. The city is famous for its Urdu Shayari (poetry).<\/p>\n<p><strong>History<\/strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2051\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/Lucknow-the-city-of-Nababs.jpg\" alt=\"Lucknow the city of Nababs\" width=\"700\" height=\"452\" \/><br \/>\nThe city of Lucknow and its adjoining parts in the Awadh region came under the successive rule of the  Gaya Bihar Sultanate, the Mughals, the Nawabs of Awadh and the British since the mid-14th century. It was also an important centre of action during the Sepoy mutiny of 1857 as well as the freedom movement against the British rule.<\/p>\n<p>Till the second decade of the 18th century, Awadh was a part of the Mughals administered by a Governor appointed by the Mughal Emperor in  Gaya Bihar. Awadh has historically been known as the granary house of India and it was strategically a key place for controlling the Doab region between the Ganga and Yamuna Rivers. Awadh has been a strong kingdom till the third Nawab; Shuja-ud-Daula succumbed to the British in the Battle of Buxar of 1964 while aiding Mir Qasim, the fugitive Nawab of Bengal.\u00a0 Thereafter, the defeated king had to cede parts of his kingdom as well as penalties to the east India Company. The British also appointed a Resident at Awadh and gradually brought it under their strong control. They, however, abstained from capturing Awadh for that would have brought them under direct confrontation with the Marathas and the Mughals, even though the latter was in decline. Lucknow came into prominence when it was promoted as the capital of Awadh by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula. The Awadhi Nawabs had made lasting contributions towards the architectural magnificence of the city.<\/p>\n<p>In 1798, the fifth Nawab, Wazir Ali abdicated and the British, subsequently, helped Saadat Khan to accede to the throne. A puppet king was installed by the British in the form of Saadat Khan, who by a treaty with the British in 1801, had given half of Awadh to the British East India Company and the state virtually became a vassal state of the Europeans. All revenues and assets of Awadh were spent behind the Britishers while the inefficient Awadhi rulers continued with their luxurious and pompous lifestyles. In 1856, the East India Company took military initiative and annexed Awadh, their long awaiting desire and put the kingdom under Sir Henry Lawrence\u2019s command. The Nawab, Wajid Ali Shah was captured and put to exile. Wajid Ali\u2019s minor son was crowned the king during the 1857 revolt during when Sir Lawrence was killed. Lucknow was sieged as well. However, the British later recaptured Awadh after the rebellion met a defeat. It was put under a chief commissioner once again.<\/p>\n<p>In 1901, Lucknow, which served as the capital of Awadh since 1775, was merged with the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (Anglicized version of Awadh) and was made the provincial capital in 1920. In 1947 after India gained independence, Lucknow became the capital of Uttar Pradesh, or the erstwhile Uttar Pradesh.<\/p>\n<p>The city had played a historical role during the modern Indian freedom movement as well. The famous Lucknow pact of 1916 was signed here while it had strong connections with the Khilafat Movement. During the Khilafat Movement, Maulana Abdul Bari of Lucknow had actively co-operated with Mahatma Gandhi and Maulana Mohammad Ali.<\/p>\n<p>The All India Kisan Sabha was formed at the Lucknow session of the Indian national Congress in 1936 to organize and lead peasant grievances against the oppressive zamindars and it played an instrumental role in igniting the farmers\u2019 movement in India.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Geography<\/strong><br \/>\nLucknow is located in the heart of the Northern Plains and is drained by the Gomti River, which divides it into Trans-Gomti and Cis-Gomti regions.
