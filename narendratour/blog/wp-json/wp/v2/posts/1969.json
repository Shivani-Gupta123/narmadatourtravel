Stretching in north-south direction on the eastern bank of the River Hooghly, it usually includes its suburbs along with its 15 million population approximately. This ranks it as the third largest metropolitan city in India and world\u2019s eighth largest agglomeration.<\/p>\n<p>The name of the city actually originates from the name Kalikata, one among the three villages in the area prior to British. In fact, Kalikata comes from Kalakshetra meaning the Land of the Goddess Kali. Located in the Ganges Delta, the city was primarily a stretched marshland that was cultivated over the decades to house the growing population. The remaining wetland is named as East Calcutta Wetlands and is accredited as wetland of international importance.<\/p>\n<p>Until 1911, Kolkata was the capital of India and the centre of advanced education, commerce, science, tradition, and politics in India. However, since 1954, it has been a centre of political aggression and financial stagnation.
