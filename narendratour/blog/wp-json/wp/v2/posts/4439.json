First we all thought he was talking on his cell phone but in fraction of seconds we realized that he was talking to us, but we didn\u2019t get what he was trying to convey to us. Aksuu asked him what was he saying, then he said, \u201clets plan a visit to a fort this weekend, no one uttered a word and Chetan was waiting for our answer, everyone though was agreeing to the plan but were thinking something. I was always ready for outings so I gave my immediate answer, after me even Aksu, Varsha and Ellu said yes. But Vaibhav and Sachin were still thinking, I thought maybe they had some other plan and they might be thinking of shuffling things after pausing for 5 minutes they both were too ready. Somewhere in my mind I had a thought, that my mom was surely going to kill me some day as each weekend I was always on some or other outing.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8567 alignright\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Harishchandragad.jpg\" alt=\"Harishchandragad\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now the whole week was to pass for Saturday and our adventure outing, till that time we have to work, our destination for the adventure outing was the famous Harishchandragad which is in the Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra. This fort as its mention in the history connecting to the Malshej Ghat for the protection of surrounding areas. All were trying to get as much information we could about the place, to reach Harishchandragad it takes around eight hours from Mumbai by road. It was Friday and only hours were left for starting our adventure journey, we had planned to leave home by 5 am, so that we reach on time and encounter less traffic in the road. We that day left on the decided time as it was a long journey. The moment we reached Malshej ghat as we read the view that Malshej ghat gave to the Harishchandragad was extremely mind blowing. Here there is no facility for food or accommodation so we were camping there.<\/p>\n<p>After reaching at the place I was thrilled to see the height of the Harishchandragad which is of 4,671 feet. The most fascinating summit on Harishchandragad is the cliff that has constantly enthralled several people since years. Facing to the west the cliff looks towards Konkan. Here is the place from you can have an awesome view of the surrounding region and also the setting of the sun. There are few spots here places in the Harishchandragad which is worth watching, we also decided to have a look at those.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Saptatirtha:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is the temple that is constructed in the lake on the eastern side and is called as \u201cSaptatirtha\u201d. In these temples you will find idols of Lord Vishnu. These idols now are shifted to the nearby caves. The water in the lake here is contaminated because of many trekkers; few years back the water which was used for drinking is not even suitable for swimming now.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Taramati Peak:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is the highest point of the fort. From behind you can have a look at Leopards here. Also as of here you can have a look at the entire Naneghat and the forts nearing Murbad.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Now it\u2019s the time to have some adventure, this voice came from Chetan in the middle breaking the silence of the breakfast table in the cafe.
