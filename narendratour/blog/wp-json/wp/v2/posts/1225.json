This shrine has two round stones that represent the breasts of Sati; Lord Shiva\u2019s wife. Vishnupad Temple in Gaya is adored alike by Hindus and Buddhists.<\/p>\n<p>Gaya is very important to devout Hindus from the perspective of salvation as Lord Rama came to Gaya with Sita for Pind Daan. When Rama went to bathe before offering Pinda Dhanam; Devi Sita saw a vision of Dasharatha who told her to offer the Pindam as he was feeling very hungry. Devi Sita compiled but this angered Rama when he came back. It was then that Phalgu river, Branhmin, Banyan Tree and cow were called by Sita to validate her story. Apart from the Banyan tree everyone denied supporting Sita. Sita cursed the Phalgu River which then lost its water and became a stretch os mere sand dunes. At the same time the Banyan tree was blessed to become evergreen and immortal.<\/p>\n<p>According to Jainism 22 out of 24 Tirthankars attained immortal salvation in Gaya and this is why Gaya is very important to the Jain followers.
