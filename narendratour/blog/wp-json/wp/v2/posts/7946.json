Also known locally as Sagarmatha, Mount Everest or the highest mountain in the world is also the most popular one. Towering high on an elevation of 8,849 meters above sea level, Mount Everest was first climbed by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953. Ever since its formation between 20 to 30 million years ago, it has not only been a source of adventure for many aspiring mountaineers but also a source of income for a major part of the Nepalese population, especially the Sherpas.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2.

Lying in the Karakoram Range, K2 is known for its raw magnetic natural beauty that leaves every mountaineer stunned at first sight. As compared to Everest, K2 is a much trickier mountain to navigate through and requires some serious mountaineering skills to climb. The first ascent was made in 1954 by Achille Compagnoni and Lino Lacedelli despite the rough, challenging and constantly changing terrain and weather conditions.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3.

The peak of Kanchenjunga may seem like a single summit but it is actually a combination of 5 peaks. The term Kanchenjunga, in Tibetan, literally translates into \u20185 treasures in the snow\u2019. Did you know that before the discovery of Everest, Kanchenjunga was known as the highest peak in the world? The region around Kanchenjunga is declared as a UNESCO world heritage site and a protected region owing to its rich and diverse range of ecosystems it is home to.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4.

It was first summited in 1956 by a Swedish climber and ever since then, it has been a mountain filled with a fascination for every avide mountaineer. One of the most exciting things about Lhotse is the fact that its base camp is located on top of a moving glacier on an elevation of 5,200 meters above sea level.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5.

Due to its very rare topographical feature, Makalu is one of the most difficult 8 thousanders to climb, even by the most seasoned climbers. The Gurung, Rai, Sherpa, and Bhotia tribes residing in these parts add a lot of colorful culture to this place making the climbing experience more wholesome.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>6.

It can be taken as a practice ground to get used to climbing in thin air and dealing with the challenges of climbing higher peaks. It is the westernmost major peak in the Khumbu sub-section at a distance of 20 kms from Mount Everest.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>7.

Locally known as Diamer, literally meaning naked mountain, this major peak rises dramatically above the traditional Himalayan views.

This dramatic peak that remains hidden mostly from the sight is famous as the 5th highest mountain peak in the Karakoram mountain ranges. Due to its extreme remoteness, it is one of the least climbed 8 thousanders in the world. It is so remote that its only access is through the center of the Karakoram mountain ranges which is the 2nd tallest mountain range in the world.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>12.
