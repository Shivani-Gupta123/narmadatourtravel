										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The supreme court of India has announced that a leave travel concession or LTC is not meant for foreign holidays and it is only meant for travel holidays within India.</p>
<p>The moment any employee goes for a foreign trip i.e. holiday outside the Indian borders, they will no longer be eligible to be covered under the provisions of section 10(5) of the income tax act.</p>
<p>The court has dismissed the appeal filed by the State bank of India against the Judgement of the  Gaya Bihar high court. It held that the amount received by the SBI employees towards their LTC claims is not liable for any sort of exemption as these employees have been to foreign destinations. The revenue had held SBI to be an ‘Assessee in default’, for not deducting the tax at the source of its employees.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8300" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Justice-Lalit-Justice-S-Ravindra-Bhat-Justice-Sudhanshu-Dhulia.jpg" alt="Justice Lalit Justice S Ravindra Bhat Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia" width="750" height="450" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Justice-Lalit-Justice-S-Ravindra-Bhat-Justice-Sudhanshu-Dhulia.jpg 750w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Justice-Lalit-Justice-S-Ravindra-Bhat-Justice-Sudhanshu-Dhulia-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></p>
<p>Section 10(5) of the income tax act exempts from the ‘total income’ the payments received as LTC. Clause (5) goes as follows: in the case of an individual, the value of any travel concession or assistance received by, or due to him, &#8211; (a) from his employer for himself and his family, in connection with his proceeding on leave to any place in India.</p>
<p>In an appeal, the SBI admitted that the travel made by its employees under LTC did involve a foreign leg and admittedly a circuitous route, as opposed to the shortest route, was taken. However, it was later on pointed out that (1) the employees did travel from one designated place in India to another place within India (although in their travel itinerary a foreign destination was also involved), and (2) the payments which were actually made to these employees was made for the shortest route of travel between 2 designated places within India. In simpler terms, no such payment was made for foreign travel although a foreign leg was included as a part of the itinerary undertaken by the employees.</p>
<p><strong>The Bench Rejected Both Of These Contentions And Made The Following Observations:</strong></p>
<p>“The contention of the appellant that there is no specific bar under section 10(5) for foreign travel and therefore a foreign journey can be availed as long as the starting and destination points remain within India is also without merits. LTC is for travel within India, from one place in India to another place in India. There should be no ambiguity on this…the 2nd argument urged by the appellant that payments made to these employees was of the shortest route of their actual travel cannot be accepted either. It has already been clarified above, that in view of the provisions of the act, the moment employees undertake travel with a foreign leg, it is not a travel within India and hence not covered under the provisions of section 10(5) of the act.</p>
<p>A foreign travel also frustrates the purpose of LTC. The basic objective of the LTC scheme was to familiarize a civil servant or a government employee to gain some perspective of Indian culture by traveling within the country. It is for that reason that the 6th pay commission rejected the demand of paying cash compensation in lieu of LTC and also rejected the demand of foreign travel…there was not intention of legislature to allow the employees to travel abroad in the garb of LTC-available by virtue of section 10(5) of the act. Therefore the revenue has a valid objection (apart from other objections which are clearly Violative of the statute), that the intention and purpose of the scheme is also violated under the garb of the tour in India, foreign travel is being availed”.</p>
<p>The court also notified that SBI cannot claim ignorance regarding the travel plans of its employees as during the settlement of LTC bills the complete facts are available before the Assessee about the details of their employee’s travels.</p>
<p>“Therefore it cannot be a case of Bonafide Mistake, as all the relevant facts were before the Assessee employer and he was therefore fully in a position to calculate the estimated income of its employees. The contention of Shri K.V. Vishwanathan, senior advocate that there may be a Bonafide Mistake by the Assessee &#8211; Employer in calculating the estimated income cannot be accepted since all the relevant documents and material were before the Assessee &#8211; employer at the relevant time and the Assessee employer, therefore, ought to have applied his mind and deducted tax at source as it was his statutory duty, under section 192(1) of the act.” the court added.</p>
<p>The court noted that many of the employees had undertaken travel to Port Blair via Malaysia, Singapore or Port Blair via Bangkok etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Covid &#8211; 19 is spreading like a ravaging wildfire throughout the world. After a brief period of respite, it has suddenly gotten worse than what it was in 2020 and the country being affected most is India. With a surge in cases every single day with no sign of it getting better, there are many countries that have put a travel ban from India. These include countries like the UK, Hong Kong and the USA.</p>
<p>Amidst this pandemic-induced chaos, the already battered aviation industry has taken yet another hit. According to the data shared by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the average daily footfall of passengers and travellers have drastically gone down from 2 lakh ever since the first time it was re-started after the first Covid-19 wave. While domestic flights will function in a calibrated and controlled manner, the impending fear of the closing up of international flights has the flyers in fear.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/International-Travel-from-India-New-Covid-Restrictions.jpg" alt="International Travel from India New Covid Restrictions" width="700" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7133" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/International-Travel-from-India-New-Covid-Restrictions.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/International-Travel-from-India-New-Covid-Restrictions-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/International-Travel-from-India-New-Covid-Restrictions-170x97.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/International-Travel-from-India-New-Covid-Restrictions-370x211.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Keeping all this in mind, let’s take a look at countries to where you can take an international flight and also the countries announcing restrictions.</p>
<h3><strong>What Is An Air Bubble?</strong></h3>
<p>An air bubble is a temporary arrangement between 2 countries to restart commercial flight services at a time when regular international flights are suspended due to Covid 19. According to this arrangement airlines from both the countries are allowed to operate, unlike in case of mission Vande Bharata where only Indian carriers were allowed to operate flight.</p>
<h3><strong>Where Can You Fly Under the Red Bubble Pact?</strong></h3>
<p>India had initially established travel bubble pacts with countries like USA, Germany and France in 2020. Ever since then, India has formed this pact with 27 different nations in all. These are: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Canada, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Iraq, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Maldives, Nepal, Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Qatar, Russia, Rwanda, Seychelles, Tanzania, Ukraine, UAE, UK, USA, Uzbekistan.</p>
<h3><strong>Which Countries Have Restricted Flights from India?</strong></h3>
<p>Ever since the second wave of Covid-19 has engulfed India, Hong Kong and the UK have suspended flights from India. The UK has put India on the red list keeping the current situation in mind whereas Hong Kong is allowing passengers with a covid negative report from a test done 72 hours prior to the journey.</p>
<h3><strong>What Is the Latest Travel Advisory from The Us?</strong></h3>
<p>The CDC has recommended people not to travel to India right now where even fully vaccinated individuals are getting re-infected. But if someone has to travel to India on an urgent basis, then they should first get fully vaccinated, and on reaching India, they should follow all the covid guidelines strictly like constantly washing hands, observing social distancing and wearing a mask at all times.</p>
<h3><strong>Who Can Travel to India From the Us?</strong></h3>
<p>These are the people who will be permitted to travel to India from the US:</p>
<ul>
<li>US citizens, permanent residents and foreign nationals holding valid US visas.</li>
<li>Any Indian national holding any type of a valid US visa.</li>
<li>Seamen of foreign nationality. Seamen holding Indian passports will also be allowed clearance from the ministry of shipping.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rejoice all pilgrims, the news you all have been waiting for is finally here. Uttarakhand government has decided to reopen Char Dham Yatra after a tumultuous and unpredictable couple of months. It was in the first time in history ever that this holy Char Dham Yatra pilgrimage was shut down due to the COVID 19 pandemic that had brought the world to a standstill. Slowly but steadily and with strict rules, various states of India are coming back to life and adopting new models to fight this deadly virus with an aim to hinder its community spread.</p>
<p>The announcement was made by the chief executive officer of Char Dham Devasthanam board Ravinath Raman. Earlier only Uttarakhand residents and locals were permitted to go for the Yatra (keeping in mind they followed all the guidelines) and for other pilgrims residing in different parts of India, online Darshan was arranged. However, now all pilgrims from different parts of India are permitted to offer their prayer. In order to have a soulful and tension-free Yatra to the holy temples of <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/kedarnath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kedarnath</a>, <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/badrinath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Badrinath</a>, <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/gangotri" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gangotri</a>, and <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/yamunotri" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yamunotri</a> the pilgrims will be required to follow a strict set of guidelines as given out by the government of Uttarakhand as mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DATE &#8211;</strong> As of 25th July 2020 Devbhoomi has opened its doors to all the pilgrims from different parts of India. Booking facility for online Yatra e pass will be available from 27th July 2020 for pilgrims travelling into Uttarakhand. This is a necessary Darshan pass every Yatri going for Char Dham is expected to carry with them.</li>
<li><strong>TEST REPORT &#8211;</strong> It is vital to get latest ICMR negative report for corona. This is another one of the vital pieces of paperwork that you will be needed to upload while filling out the online application form on the official website of <a href="https://badrinath-kedarnath.gov.in/" rel="nofollow">badrinath-kedarnath.gov.in</a>.</li>
<li><strong>MANDATORY REGISTRATION &#8211;</strong> As opposed to the initial Yatra days when registration could be done on the spot now with new rules being set in place, the registration procedure for Char Dham Yatris have changed substantially. Getting prior online registration is now made mandatory. Once the registration is successfully done the pilgrims will have to download the Yatra e-pass which will, later on, have to be presented to the temple authorities when asked for it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note &#8211;</strong> The online registration is free of charge and will be granted on a first come first serve basis.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ONLINE BOOKING FOR RITUALS &#8211;</strong> The pilgrims can now easily book for puja, path, Aarti or Bhog services through the above mentioned online portal and these rituals and procedures will be performed by the priest or the Vedpathi on behalf of the pilgrims.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the above-mentioned papers you must carry a valid ID proof, residential proof and also quarantine center information if in case the officials need to check it at any point of your trip. Be sure to follow strict social distancing norms and other rules and regulations as mentioned above. We wish you a safe and secure journey.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In view of the COVID 19 pandemic outbreak, Amarnath Yatra 2020 has been cancelled as announced by the official spokesperson for the Sri amaranth shrine board (SASB) on 21st July 2020. Initially, the government had mentioned that they will be taking necessary steps and provide devotees an option to offer their prayer at the holy cave of Baba Barfani through one rout. However, with an everyday increasing trend in the cases and with no immediate solution, the Yatra was altogether cancelled. This is a move that will keep not only the devotees but also the locals in Jammu and Kashmir safe from potential virus spread. Amaranth Yatra is one of the most pious and holiest of all the pilgrimages undertaken by devout Hindus. So naturally, it came as a huge shock for various Hindu religious leaders, organizations and right-wing political groups as well. The decision was taken through a video conference call conducted by GC Murmu keeping in mind that around 14,600 people in J and K have been infected.<br />
<img decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Amarnath-Yatra-2020-Cancelled.jpg" alt="Amarnath Yatra 2020 Cancelled" width="700" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7009" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Amarnath-Yatra-2020-Cancelled.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Amarnath-Yatra-2020-Cancelled-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Amarnath-Yatra-2020-Cancelled-170x97.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Amarnath-Yatra-2020-Cancelled-370x211.jpg 370w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
The spokesman stated, “based on the current and prevailing circumstances, the board has decided with a heavy heart that it is not suitable or even advisable to hold and conduct this year’s Shri Amarnath Ji Yatra and regret to express its cancellation for 2020.” They also added “the board is aware of and respects the sentiments of millions of devotees and to keep the religious sentiments alive. The board shall continue to show the live telecast and promote virtual Darshan of the morning and evening Aarti. All the traditions and rituals will be carried out by the temple’s pundits as per the past practices.” Another reason for the cancellation cited by the officials was that the pandemic has already stretched the health administration to its limit and many health care workers and security personnel are also getting infected. The focus right now should primarily be on containing the local transmissions.</p>
<p>Also present in the meeting was the chief secretary BVR Subrahmanyam, SABS’s CEO Bipul Pathal Among other significant board officers. They had come together to discuss the supreme court’s order given on 13th July, wherein the court had left the decision of conducting the Yatra to the state administrative board after a complete assessment of the practical and ground realities, arrangements and how the pandemic may seriously cause a devastating effect on the healthcare system in J and K.</p>
<p>Ever since the beginning of the nationwide lockdown in March all the religious places have been shut down for visit to public. Ever since then the cases in Jammu and Kashmir has continued to spike and go up. However, this is not the first time the Yatra has been cancelled. In 2019, the Yatra was curtailed following the repeated terror threats when the union government had decided to completely nullify articles 370 and 35A. Due to these restrictions were imposed on various daily activities and regional movements.</p>

<h3><strong>Amarnath Yatra Virtual Darshan</strong></h3>
<p>Although the Yatra is cancelled the board of Amaranth shrine has decided to offer continuous morning and evening live telecast of Aarti Darshan so that devotees don’t miss out on the holy experience. people can now witness the blessings of Baba Barfani from the comforts of their homes. The telecast will be showcased in the Doordarshan channel. These steps are being taken to not hurt the religious sentiments of the devotees who make all kinds of effort to offer their prayer to the lord. However, it’s better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<h3><strong>Amarnath Yatra</strong></h3>
<p>With the Amaranth pilgrimage Yatra cancelled for the year 2020 devotees are also simultaneously looking forward to going for the holy Amaranth Yatra for 2023. Planning and ticket booking for next year can be easily done through a reliable tour operator right now! There is still hope, do not feel completely disheartened, and go ahead and secure a seat for your Darshan of baba Barfani for next year of Amaranth Yatra 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the domestic flights carefully resuming operations during these unprecedented times, there is a lot of confusion surrounding these flight travels. Students, office workers, and other people, who were stuck in different parts of the countries ever since the announcement made by PM Narmada Modi to carry out the biggest lockdown the world has ever seen, are now able to book their flights back home and be with their family.</p>
<h2><strong>What to Expect:</strong></h2>
<p>The limited scale and highly controlled commencement of the aviation sector in India has brought about some much-needed relief since it’s reopening from Monday (25/5/2020). The <a href="https://www.india.gov.in/"><strong>government of India</strong></a> has issued a set of do’s and don’ts for the passengers undertaking the journey via flight from Mumbai to  Gaya Bihar or generally anywhere except Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal.</p>
<p>First of all, the passengers will expect some steep rise in the ticket price since planes will be functioning and operating at minimal and effectively reduced capacity. However, the government has set up a set of strict guidelines for the aviation companies and set a bar for fixing the ticket fares.</p>
<p>Here is a step by step guide of what you will be experiencing:</p>
<ul>
