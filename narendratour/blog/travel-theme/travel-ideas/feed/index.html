										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Travelling is a passion for some, a necessity for others. But the kind of traveller you are does not in any away impact the importance of travelling in living a life worthier. In its many facets, travelling has always fed the soul.

Here are some things that explains why it is so very essential for everyone to travel, as much and however one can-</p>

<h3><strong>Travelling is the panacea to life’s woes</strong></h3>
<p>Well, not all of them though. Of course when you are without the money and the means to travel, you can get even deeper entrenched in misery. But for most of life’s poignant woes, travelling is important to help you heal with them.</p>
<p>A change of place is the thing that can absolutely pull you out of a heartbreak. Of course not immediately. But when you do want to heal emotionally, getting to travel places and exploring them sets off your mind such that you gradually begin to come out of your mess.</p>
<p>Because travelling isn’t routine, it gives you a fresh lease of life- one that offers things so new and varied that it is most likely to offset even crucial life problems.</p>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Travelling is fun</strong></h3>
<p>Undoubtedly! Getting to explore pretty new destinations and meeting interesting new people is one of the many perks you get when you go travelling. By easing the worries of life at least for the moment, travelling allows you a more fun approach to living- one that seeks beauty in every nook and corner of the whole wide world. In fact, there are very few things that will amuse you in life like travelling does!</p>
<h3><strong>Travel is exciting</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9542" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Travel-is-exciting.jpg" alt="Travel is exciting" width="900" height="558" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Travel-is-exciting.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Travel-is-exciting-300x186.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Travel-is-exciting-768x476.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Who doesn’t like the anticipation of getting to soak in new sights and experience the newest of places? Those picture perfect beaches, postcard landscapes, beckoning valleys and adventure oozing mountains that has made even your Insta feed a travel haven is just enough reason for you to go barging into the world!</p>
<p>A thing of beauty is a joy forever. With their unparalleled exuberance and diversity, travel destinations stir up your soul and lends you such joy that prods you on excitedly through life, or at least till your next travel sojourn!</p>

<h3><strong>The importance of travelling rests also on the plate!</strong></h3>
<p>Travelling isn’t just about collecting introspective experiences and having cultural enlightenment though. Venturing into newer lands is also your best bet of letting your taste buds savor the authentic taste of the place. Trying out new cuisines in the most indigenous way possible is the best way to satiate the foodie soul in you. Not only does it impart the local flavours and the local taste but also is the best way to do away with all drooling at the sight of every fancy foreign dish on social media. Traditional food and traditional customs are best explored the traditional way, so take your next travel journey as the way you need to go about for rendering that offbeat taste to your tongue.</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling enriches you</strong></h3>
<p>Travelling also enriches you with experiences. Your life becomes an amalgamation of the most interesting stories, of incredible happenings and diverse encounters that is your treasure for life. By rendering you richer in experiences and memories, travelling can also further your creative pursuits. The importance of travelling is such that it makes your life all the more richer even when it can take a toll on your bank balance!</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling is learning in itself</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9544" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Travelling-is-learning-in-itself.jpg" alt="Travelling is learning in itself" width="900" height="587" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Travelling-is-learning-in-itself.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Travelling-is-learning-in-itself-300x196.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Travelling-is-learning-in-itself-768x501.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>It isn’t also only the beauty that beckons you into exploring the world. Travelling is important because it also makes you culturally informative and historically enlightened. While there are folks who travel just for the sake of it, travel is as much an experience to be lived as it is cherished.</p>
<p>Roaming the alleys of forts and palaces deeply seethed with history or seeking rich cultural experiences through discovering age old legacies is the best way to be aware of the world you live in. Travelling is also more effective an educational tool than education itself! Such is the importance of travelling that we seek respite in travel and also sap excitement out of it!</p>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Travelling enlightens you</strong></h3>
<p>By making you more accustomed with diverse facets of different parts of the world, travelling also enlightens you. It makes you see the world in a different light, one that need not necessarily be as rosy or as dark as your own existence. From teaching you to adjust and compromise, get accustomed and uninhibited, travelling basically sets you up for life. Like we said earlier, travelling is education- the kind that educates you to ace life itself.</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling sets you up for life</strong></h3>
<p>By expanding your knowledge, travels also enhances your prospects in life. You learn and relearn so much by travelling that life comes surprisingly easier to you. Because you would have witnessed comfort and adventure all in once, you know how to tackle life situations better. You are always prepared for the worst even when you don’t give your hope of the best. That’s just how practical travelling helps you be. In teaching you to view life through a colored glass, travelling ensures you aren’t just stuck with the basic monochromatic version of the world.</p>
<h3><strong>Traveling gets you going (literally and figuratively!)</strong></h3>
<p>When you are out on a travel sojourn, you cease to be preoccupied with life’s tiring musings. Even when you travel just because you like it, travelling still serves your purpose. In being even your addiction, travelling gets you going on the high. You tend to soar like a free bird, far removed from the regular humdrum of monotonity. Naturally, when you travel, your stress somehow loses its intensity of having you worried. And that’s just the perfect way you need to live life. Travelling lets you while away your stress without as much a damn as life expects out of you.</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling also leads the way to your soul</strong></h3>
<p>Travelling also lets you connect with yourself. Specially when you travel solo, you get this deeper introspection into life and into your own soul. The solitary times help you discover your essence and perceive your own existence in a very different understanding. That’s perhaps the best point to enumerate about the importance of travelling. Because knowing oneself inside out is crucial to living a life of fulfillment and clarity, one that will not drive you to disenchantment.</p>
<p>Also, when you travel, you have a deeper sense of the vastness this entity called the world encompasses. This makes you realise just how minuscule our lives are, just how unnecessarily occupied we remain with our own bodings even when we are as insignificant as anyone else. In manifesting your own triviality, travelling teaches you to be modest and humble.</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling is lifetime investment</strong></h3>
<p>Travelling as an action might be fleeting but the many memories of that wonderful bachelorette trip will linger on all life long. Many a time, it is these eras lived that help you tide over life when things aren’t particularly easy. But even otherwise, travelling gifts you such moments of pleasure and fun that are ever lasting, memories that will make you smile in fond remembrance every time you drift off to wonderland.</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling is an adventure in itself</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9543" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Travelling-is-an-adventure-in-itself.jpg" alt="Travelling is an adventure in itself" width="900" height="502" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Travelling-is-an-adventure-in-itself.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Travelling-is-an-adventure-in-itself-300x167.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Travelling-is-an-adventure-in-itself-768x428.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Treading new terrains, dealing with unknown people and finding your way through hitherto unfamiliar lands can sound a bit intimidating but as you master the art of travelling, you will begin to view such unfamiliarity as something adventurous rather than offsetting. Travelling becomes all the more exciting when it is challenging. Even when you are travelling in some quaint, sleepy town, maneuvering through the lesser known place is what keeps you upbeat about experiencing this adventure called travelling. Travelling is as much a rush of adrenaline as it is a surge of excitement. And once you have successfully made it through such an experience, you would acknowledge how travelling also boosts your confidence and leaves you craving for more and more of such adventure.</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling is wholesome entertainment!</strong></h3>
<p>It might not be so obvious but planning a travel trip is as exciting as travelling itself! The anticipation of the long awaited trip and even the intricacies of packing and sorting, of booking and prepping have you as much excited as the travel day itself. It is also in this expectation of living a new experience, of joining in with all the hustle and bustle that makes travelling all the more enticing and thrilling. Because the journey is worth more than the destination and travel lets you know exactly why this has been the universal saga all throughout.</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling is Instagram goals</strong></h3>
<p>However superficial this might be, there’s no denying how breaking it on Insta keeps us all hooked in the times of today. In fact, people now travel as much for their social life as for their own pleasure. The excitement of travelling to new places increases manifold at the anticipation of how your latest vacation pics will be the talk of the grammars. It is also this excitement of being talked about that drives many to travel in the modern world. You might not be agreeing on this particular ‘importance of travelling’ but to the extent it makes you feel good about showing off your latest plunge, travelling indeed is goals!</p>
<h3><strong>Travel is also the worthiest leisure</strong></h3>
<p>Leisure in today’s world is a luxury. One that therefore must be efficiently utilised so as to make every moment matter. There’s no luxury in the world that transcends the ecstasy of travel. In enriching you with experiences, in letting you de- stress, in making you happier, travelling is the worthiest luxury you can buy.</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling makes you happy</strong></h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9545" src="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Travelling-makes-you-happy.jpg" alt="Travelling makes you happy" width="900" height="558" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Travelling-makes-you-happy.jpg 900w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Travelling-makes-you-happy-300x186.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Travelling-makes-you-happy-768x476.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>Travelling also makes you happier. By reducing stress, by helping yourself let loose, by rewarding you with the most luxurious of experiences, travel has a way of making the heart go fonder and happier. For many, travelling is freedom. The importance of travelling is all the more manifested in it being a delightful break from the monotony of routine and the boredom of schedule. In being an experience so liberating, travelling instantly perks up your mood and leaves you happier.</p>
<h3><strong>Travelling will be your most exclusive luxury</strong></h3>
<p>Not just exquisite, travelling is also exclusive to you. It is one of those very few experiences that you share only with yourself. Because travelling affects different people differently, your individual experience is only your own. That as a thought itself is so relaxing, of having something very intimate with the world, of something that is not forged but created. Travelling is so exclusive to you that even when it makes you humble it also leaves you resplendent in a pride of connecting so deep to the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is a known fact that the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus"><strong>Coronavirus pandemic</strong></a> has brought the whole world on its knees. Everyone is facing their share of problems due to this unexpected pandemic that has encapsulated the globe and continues to grow without any promise of subsiding in the near future. As the world thanks to the fighters and warriors in white who are battling this deadly virus on a daily basis, some people cannot stop themselves from wondering what it would be like when everything goes back to normal. But the question is will things truly go back to what it was?</p>
<p>Out of all the industries facing the severe backlash caused due to this unknown virus, the Travel industry is the most brutally affected. In the blink of an eye, the traditional travel ways will see a sudden yet much-needed change that could take years and years to get back to the so-called normal track. The worst part about this whole thing is that since the world is plunging deeper into this pandemic every day, will anyone feel truly carefree while going around the world? However, there is no need to lose hope as the travel industry will be back and how since 10% of the entire global workforce comprises employees in the travel industry, directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>After the complete elimination of the virus here are some ways that you can undertake while traveling to keep yourself safe and get rid of any probable causes of COVID 19:</p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="/blog/covid-19-mumbai-to- Gaya Bihar-domestic-air-travel-experience/">COVID 19 &#8211; Mumbai to  Gaya Bihar Domestic Air Travel Experience</a></p>
<h3><strong>Adopt A Rigorous Disinfecting Routine</strong></h3>
<p>It is a long shot since air travel will be a common thing again however if you do have to travel by air or even by road be sure to follow a strict regime of disinfecting everything. This can be done by carrying bottles of alcohol-based sanitizers and disinfectants. You should spray them on your luggage and carry on and anything you buy from outside to eliminate any possibility. Strictly follow the protocols given out by who of carrying masks and gloves which you should also keep disinfecting in intervals. All the surfaces must also be cleaned on a regular basis with the help of disinfecting sprays and wet wipes dipped in disinfectants which will keep your belongings safer.</p>
<h3><strong>Opt For Road Trips</strong></h3>
<p>Lengthy travel plans should be suspended for the near future as it may increase the chances of a sudden spike in people getting infected. People should start traveling in their cars and going on road trips. What better than traveling and exploring in your own car? It is a convenient way and one of the most economical ways of traveling since you will entirely be in control of disinfecting your whole car and keeping yourself safe from getting prone to this horrible disease. it may take a lot of effort, quick thinking and you will have to take care of numerous other things but it will all be worth it since prevention is better than cure.</p>
<h3><strong>Avoid Staying At Hotels</strong></h3>
<p>Hotels will prove to be a hotbed for the people getting infected since people from different parts of the world use the hotel to stay while traveling. Some people may be potential carriers for the virus and your stay there would prove to be fatal. Instead, you can go for camping activities or choose to stay at one of the many available Airbnb options available since there you will be responsible directly for cleaning the space and disinfecting it according to your liking and satisfaction that too at a regular basis. People generally prefer sanitizing their space as per their own satisfaction as they are doubtful of the way the hotel staff clean. A relatively safer option would be booking aBnB preferably in a remote part of the region.</p>
<h3><strong>Travel Domestic</strong></h3>
<p>The world is undergoing a major economic crisis that has negatively impacted the life of numerous people across the globe. This will allow people to travel locally and domestically rather than going on lengthy international vacation trips. This will also allow you to travel to the local places and help the small scale industries to revive their businesses that may have gotten worse over the period of the pandemic. Traveling domestic also eliminates the possibility of getting the virus-infected through some foreign source like in an airport, a cab, or some other random surface you may unknowingly expose yourself to. Traveling domestic to the remote regions will allow you to experience some time away from the madness of city life and have a fun time as well while giving you the opportunity to getting to know more about your culture.</p>
<h3><strong>Pack Smartly And Carefully</strong></h3>
<p>It goes without saying that you will be packing differently now since you will not be including a lot of things that in the past you may have deemed unimportant. Remember that large bottles of sanitizers are not permitted in the carry-on baggage inside the flight, in this case you can choose to carry a much smaller and miniature bottle of sanitizers in your carry bag. You can choose to section out your clothes inside the suitcase inside small plastic baggies which you can also easily disinfect and keep your clothes also safe. Do not forget to pack extra pairs of surgical gloves and face masks without which all this packing would be futile.</p>
<p>Who knew that the world would see these days and will change the travel industry so drastically? All you have to do is travel smarter and safer. The only good thing to come out of this is the restoration of the natural wildlife in the world and the healing of many human-made crisis that has contributed to climate change. Some people are calling this pandemic &#8216;a great reset&#8217; while others are seeing it as one of the ways of creating awareness about safe travels. Whatever the reason is, a few things are certain that the travel industry may take years to restore traveling to the way it was and it will never be the same. All we could do is follow precautions and keep ourselves safe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do misconceptions about private jet travel keep you from experiencing more freedom and greater luxury? If so, you are going to miss out on various benefits after examining all the facts. Let’s debunk some common myths that could be limiting your options and depriving you of this exceptional air travel alternative.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Private-Jet.jpg" alt="Private Jet" width="700" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6961" srcset="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Private-Jet.jpg 700w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Private-Jet-300x171.jpg 300w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Private-Jet-170x97.jpg 170w, https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Private-Jet-370x211.jpg 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h3><strong>01. Private Jet Hire Costs More than Ownership</strong></h3>
<p>One of the biggest misunderstandings about private jet charter is that you must pay a premium price to fly in a safe, high-end aircraft. This is not true. Private jet aircraft are certified by third-party auditors to ensure both plane safety and crew competence. Private jets must meet the same standards of safety as the commercial planes offer to their customers.</p>
<p>With the private jet hire, you do not pay more for guaranteed availability. Fractional ownership companies have more clients than planes. They rely on charter companies for the guaranteed availability they provide. Fractional jet ownership is not always cheaper over time than charter service. With private jet charter, you pay only for the flights you use. By contrast, fractional ownership requires an upfront payment and a long-term contract. This can be very costly if you don’t use the aircraft as planned or if other conflicts arise. Let’s check out some of the myths related to <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/heli-booking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Private Jet Services</strong></a> mentioned below:</p>
<p>It’s also untrue that you must request empty-leg pricing in order to receive it. Most private jet hire services outsource all empty legs as a matter of course for one-way trips. This creates savings for travelers and private jet charter companies alike.</p>
<h3><strong>02. Jet Ownership Is More Flexible Than Jet Charter</strong></h3>
<p>Jet ownership requires a long-term commitment and a significant cash investment. Private jet hire gives you the freedom to fly on your own terms. You can hire private jets as needed; choose the right plane for any trip, and save money on empty leg flights.</p>
<h3><strong>03. Large Companies Use Different Planes</strong></h3>
<p>Private jets are found in varied shapes and sizes. Private jet charter companies are fully equipped to provide the private jet aircraft that best serves your needs. For selecting the plane for you, you don’t need to look for the size of the company.</p>
<h3><strong>04. Jet Charter Is Only Good For Business Travel</strong></h3>
<p>Jet charter offers VIP customer care, complete privacy, more luxury, and also offers you much greater flexibility as compared to the commercial flights whether it be flying for your business tour. Regardless of the destination, there’s never a hassle with commercial hubs or long airport lines.</p>
<h3><strong>05. Jet Ownership Is More Convenient Than Private Jet Charter</strong></h3>
<p>Owning a jet doesn’t mean more convenience when your private jet charter can be ready to go within a few hours. One phone call reserves your plane wherever and whenever you wish. Just drive to the airport, park beside the unmarked jet, and your pilot will greet you personally. Within minutes, you’ll be in the air.</p>
<p>Stock the plane with your favorite foods, beverages, music, and films. Bring the kids and pets. Fly straight to over 5,000 destinations worldwide. Why bother investing in costly jet ownership when you can have it all with the private jet charter?</p>

<h3><strong>Why Take A Holiday In The Tea Estates Of Darjeeling?</strong></h3>
<p>Tea Tourism is a comparatively brand new idea in Darjeeling but it is successfully taking a lead in this region. Darjeeling is after all the Mecca of tea as well as sprawling estates producing what we are familiar with as the “Champagne of Teas” to the delight of the world. There are 80 operational tea gardens in Darjeeling that extends across thousands of acres of land area on open hill slopes. High on the hills with cool breeze as well as misty weather, planters as well as workers come together. A journey to these huge stretches of tea plantations is all about foggy mornings, tea leaves blossoming under the sun, lovely walks to see variety of types of tea as well as of course, sipping your favourite brew. Here’s your direction to exploring the most excellent tea gardens of Darjeeling.</p>
<p><strong>1. The Glenburn Tea Estate</strong></p>
<p>Step into the peaceful world of Glenburn, a tea estate recognized by Scottish tea planters in 1860. It sprawls over the 1600 acres of green forests, rolling hills, tea picker villages, diverse landscape with birds, butterflies as well as river valleys. For stay there are two lovely bungalows, each comprising four suites and huge gardens.</p>
<p><strong>2. Makaibari Tea Estate</strong></p>
<p>Makaibari Tea Estate is the creator of Darjeeling’s costliest tea and one of the oldest tea gardens in Darjeeling. There are village home stays and Eco Huts for accommodation to experience the local life and tea gardens here.</p>
<p><strong>3. Happy Valley Tea Estate</strong></p>
<p>Traveling through tea gardens established on the gentle hill slopes of Darjeeling is the ideal way to start your day at the Happy Valley Tea Estate. With agricultural estate as old as 150 years along with picture-perfect stretches it’s the best place to know everything about tea from withering, rolling, fermenting and drying. Stay in the home-stays or hotels nearby.</p>
<p><strong>4. The Chamong Tea Estate</strong></p>
<p>Located in the hazy hills of Darjeeling, Chamong Tea Estate stretches over the 900 acres of lush green land that house a tea plantation, a tea plant as well as a village for the tea pickers. Chamong runs its own tea estate tours and offers home-stays with meals.</p>
<p><strong>5. Goomtee Tea Resort</strong></p>
<p>Lesser recognized than its famous Neighbors’ Makaibari as well as Glenburn, visitors at Goomtee get to stay in about a 100-year-old heritage tea estate bungalow at a stature of about 4000 feet, with sweeping views of the valleys, tea gardens along with mountains.</p>
<p>So all tea lovers pack your bags &#8211; Travelling to stay and enjoy these leafy estates is as stimulating as tea, and it is positively a terrific idea.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Visiting Char Dham Yatra is a cherished dream of every devout Hindu devout wants to visit at least once in their lifetime. The Yatra cannot be done throughout the year as due to the highly elevated locations of all the pilgrimages, it is difficult to access the sites during the winter season. It was quite difficult and tedious to complete this Yatra a few years back but now the time has been changed and pilgrims avail themselves of helicopter services to complete this divine journey. However, certain questions are running in the minds of the pilgrims and we have compiled some of the most common queries of the tourists about <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/chardham-yatra-by-helicopter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>helicopter services to Char Dham Yatra</strong></a>.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4384" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Chardham-Helicopter-FAQs.jpg" alt="Chardham Helicopter FAQs" width="741" height="486" /></p>
<h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Q 1: What Kind Of Documentation Is Required While Boarding The Flight?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Ans-</strong> If you are an international tourist then you must carry your passport with you and in the case of Indian passengers you need to carry any valid ID proofs like a Voter ID card, PAN Card, Aadhar Card, or Driving License. In the case of a student, you can bring your school/ college ID Card.</p>
<h3><strong>Q 2: Is There Any Kind Of Limitation On Baggage?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Ans-</strong> Yes, you need to carry a limited weight of baggage along with you. It depends upon the helicopter you are opting for but mostly 5 kg handbags and 15 kg of cargo bags are allowed per person. However, the handbags and other belongings like laptops also need to go through security checking.</p>
<h3><strong>Q 3: Is There Any Provision Of A Wheelchair For Ill-Health Tourists?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Ans-</strong> Yes, of course, we provide wheelchair facilities to those who are of ill-health. Passengers are requested to give the prior information at the time of booking as the facility is limited. However, certain helicopter service providers may ask you for extra charges for providing you with the wheelchair facility.</p>
<h3><strong>Q 4: Can It Be Possible To Book A One-Way Ticket Or Only Round Way Tickets Are Available?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Ans-</strong> Yes, we provide you the provision of both kinds of tickets- one way and round way. So, feel free to reach us if you want to book a one-way tour.</p>
<h3><strong>Q 5: What In Case My Ticket Stands Cancelled? How Much Amount Would Be Refunded To Me?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Ans-</strong> If the cancelation is being done due to any error from our side then you will get the whole sum amount that you paid but if the cancellation is done from your side then as per our company’s cancelation policy we will charge you with the cancellation charges accordingly.

<h3><strong>Q 6: I Am Travelling With My 3-Year Old Child So How Much Concession Can I Get On The Whole Sum Amount Of The Ticket?</strong></h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Growing Demand of Helicopter Services in India and Its Uses</strong><br />
Helicopter services in India are at an all-time high. With its demands on a constant rise in various sectors of the industry, the helicopter services are being incorporated for its convenience and comfort. There are almost 276 active and working helicopters in the field and this industry also has the largest share in the section of general aviation. A few years back helicopter usage for commercial purposes was extremely limited and was only utilized by the higher class of the society however, that is not the situation now. Currently there are numerous helicopter services providers that deal in offering various different types of services. The helicopter services are now being utilized in various ways and given below are the prime markets where this industry predicts a promising market for providing heli – charter services as per various market researches.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3953" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Helicopter-Revolution-in-India.jpg" alt="Helicopter Revolution in India" width="741" height="486" /></p>
<h3><strong>Some Of These Services Include:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Pilgrimage Uses</strong></p>
<p>Helicopter services make the pilgrimage journey easier and more convenient. Pilgrimage destinations like char dham yatra, Vaishno devi, Amarnath yatra, Machail mata temple yatra etc. these services are made available with an aim of eliminating all the difficulties that follows while walking your way up to the destination. The booking for pilgrimage journeys kick start very early from the date of opening of the temple kapat. People running low on time to visit these pilgrimage sites and also senior citizens who are unable to go on the yatra due to some illness or disease prefer going on these spiritual quests via helicopter services.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Char Dham Yatra by Helicopter:</strong> The char dham sites are located at massive heights and getting there is quiet a challenging task and normally requires you to travel a distance of 1,067 kms over a period of 10 – 12 days. Covering <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/chardham-yatra-by-helicopter">char dham yatra via helicopter</a> will allow you to skip all the difficult and testing parts and have a spiritual experience in maximum two days.</li>
<li><strong>Vaishno Devi Yatra by Helicopter:</strong> Going upwards to ‘mata ke darbar’, is not an easy task and the entire route is extremely steep and requires the pilgrim to go on a tough walking journey. However the introduction of <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/vaishno-devi-yatra-by-helicopter.html">helicopter services to Vaishno Devi</a> cuts down the walking distance from 14 kms to just half a km from Sanjichhat helipad.</li>
<li><strong>Amarnath Yatra by Helicopter:</strong> This has to be one of the toughest pilgrimages in India and is located on an elevation of 3,888 metres above sea level. The distance covered will be 45 kms which normally the pilgrims cover in 3 to 4 days. However going on <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/amarnath-tour">helicopter yatra to amaranth</a> will allow you to complete the journey in 1 day and will drop you off at just 600 metres from the main cave entrance.</li>
<li><strong>Kedarnath Yatra by Helicopter:</strong> This char dham site is famous for being the toughest dham to cover due to its remote location and steep hills. A <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/kedarnath-yatra-by-helicopter.html">helicopter yatra to kedarnath</a> will land you directly at just a mere distance of 500 metres from the main temple which cuts down all the difficulties from your holy journey.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are planning on going for a pilgrimage yatra via a helicopter ride then you should remember to book your helicopter journey 4 months prior to the opening of the kapat. The frequency of these pilgrimage services via helicopters have increased at an astounding rate and continues to grow. The oldest helicopter services for various pilgrimage services are still provided by the government company Pawan Hans. There are a number of companies offering helicopter services to various pilgrimage destinations in India making spirituality easily available to everyone in a comfortable manner.</p>
<p><strong>Air Taxi Services</strong></p>
<p>Air taxis are becoming a common occurrence nowadays and people are availing the services of a helicopter service in the form of air taxis. Currently a Kerala based aviation company called Thumbay aviation is providing the services of flying up to 6 passengers for one way. The one way fare is going to be Rs. 4,130/- per person which includes all the taxes. The city of Bengaluru is known for its traffic issues and traffic jams. The airport of Bengaluru is located at a distance of 2 hours from the main town. One of the major issues faced by the people commuting to and fro the airport is the problem of excessive traffic. This revolutionary helicopter service flies from the main city of Bengaluru to the Kempegowda airport. This change will reduce the travel time from over three hours to just 15 minutes.  This is the first air taxi service in India and this hope to increase the advent of air taxi services in India.</p>
<p><strong>Private Charter Services</strong></p>
<p>Helicopters have always been used for charter services one of them being business. People can now travel with ease from one place to the other in a limited time period and come back as quickly without wasting any time. This is the best option chosen for offering quick and luxurious service to business men, actors, and actresses etc. who require traveling on regular basis and need to get to places quickly. There are several heli charter companies coming up currently who offer various cost effective and affordable packages for private, corporate and business charter services. In case someone has to travel the same day and attend multiple meetings on various locations then availing the services of a helicopter is considered to be a smart choice. Although the affluent classes of the population have a lot of money but they lack time and they are now not willing hold back with so many companies offering various helicopter services.</p>
<p><strong>Entertainment Services</strong></p>
<p>Helicopter shots have always been a huge part of offering enigmatic and long ranging scenes in movies and tv shows. With the current wave of helicopter services, the entertainment industry is also utilizing its benefits of having a bird’s eye view. The aerial shots make the scene look more dramatic and grand. Production houses are nowadays hiring helicopter for not only shooting movies and tv shows but adding a certain depth to music videos as well. The demand for helicopters in this field has substantially gone up and continues to show a promising rise. The helicopters are equipped with powerful cameras which capture epic shots from the world above and add a sense of cinematic brilliance to it.</p>
<p><strong>Wedding Services</strong></p>
<p>Weddings are not only the most memorable day of your life but it is also an extremely crucial time. People also want a wedding where they leave a lasting impression in the minds of their guests. Nowadays grooms have the option of stepping out in style from a helicopter, or whisking their brides away in one or even propose in front of the helicopter. Renting a helicopter for marriage purposes has now become a trend since its services can be availed due to its low costing and easy availability. Helicopter at a wedding also symbolizes glory and happiness since it makes the bride as well as the groom feel extremely special. The couple will also be able to get a private ride around the wedding area as well as have a flower shower on the visiting guests. Having a helicopter [resent at your wedding will definitely make your wedding memorable not only to you and your other half but also to the guests attending.</p>
<p><strong>Election Campaigning Services</strong></p>
<p>Political parties hire the services of helicopter beforehand for campaigning purposes prior to the voting season. Politicians use this method to woo as many voters as they want and reach out to remote regions and gather their votes. Politicians and ministers address to large crowds quickly from one place to the other on a daily basis and can cover large distances easily. Helicopter provider companies are paid huge sums of money from the parties and allow accessibility to various destinations. Helicopters have always been a sign of power and impact and since they don’t need runways this is chosen as one of the most appropriate ways of travelling and covering large distances. Helicopters are not only quicker but are also a safer option for travelling for politicians.</p>
<p><strong>Air Ambulance Services</strong></p>
<p>People in India don’t receive the proper medical attention they need during the crucial moments of emergency. There are several hospitals in India offering this service like Apollo and Medanta along with some other in south India. The patients will be received by a helicopter at some price, which will be equipped with some of the basic equipment and amenities along with a doctor. The cost of this air ambulance is high since the company is required to pay the crew, the doctors as well as the maintenance, however it is a small price to pay to the save the life of your loved one during the crucial hours. Along with transferring patients in critical conditions this service is also utilized when an organ transfer is needed at a crucial time. Air ambulances have been successful in saving lives and will continue to do so in future as well.</p>

It&#8217;s very popular among young people with lots of hip hop and rap street performances, and young people who likes to dress up in a variety of weird and funny styles.</p>
<p>Within walking distance you&#8217;ll find NAMBA which is popular for being the entertainment district of Osaka. Namba is famous for its great cuisine and &#8220;Kuidaore&#8221; eat till you drop food culture and you&#8217;ll find a huge variety of eateries there. Namba is also the place to go for electronics goods, e.g. the BIC CAMERA store.</p>

Dotonbori is like Namba the place to be when it comes to restaurants. The Dotonbori canal runs through Namba and is one of the famous symbols of Osaka. Some of the landmarks of Dotonbori are the KANI DORAKU CRAB (a huge installation featuring a massive crab which can move its arms and eyes, and is outside the KANI DORAKU restaurant) and the GLICO MAN neon sign.</p>

Among other attractions in the Osaka bay area you&#8217;ll find Osaka aquarium (Kaiyukan). It is very nicely laid out and among the largest aquariums in the world. It is home to a huge number of species and marine animals and one of the most popular attractions is probably the gigantic whale shark &#8220;kai-kun&#8221; as well as the dolphins and penguins.</p>

Guess I had to mention it, Osaka&#8217;s most famous landmark! Located centrally in Osaka in the &#8220;Chuo-ku&#8221; district lies the Magestic castle in a beautiful park which has been named &#8220;Osaka Castle Park&#8221;&#8230; naturally. The castle was originally built in 1583 by Hideyoshi Toyotomi, but as it went through severe damage through the years it was rebuilt according to the original appearance in 1931. Although the castle has been reconstructed many of the key parts of the castle complex have remained such as the gates and turrets. Today it serves as a symbol of Osaka, and many people enjoy the recreational areas of the park particularly during the cherry blossom season.</p>
<p>The castle is illuminated at night making it a beautiful sight.</p>
<p><strong>05. Umeda Sky Building</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3894" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Umeda-Sky-Building.jpg" alt="Umeda Sky Building" width="700" height="448" /><br />
If you want an amazing 360-degree view over Osaka Umeda Sky Building is the place. The building is quite easy recognizable as it has quite a distinct architecture with a bridge connecting the two towers. The Umeda Sky Building also popularly known as the Floating Garden Observatory and the resulting view of the city from the observation deck is spectacular, particularly at night time. In the basement of the building you&#8217;ll find the TAKIMI-KOJI GOURMET STREET, set in the old days Osaka theme, which has quite a number of restaurants and adds contrast to the modern style of the building. Outside in the court yard of the building there&#8217;s usually something on such as different markets or venues, particularly at Christmas with European Christmas style markets.</p>
<p><strong>06. Tempozan Ferris Wheel</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3893" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Tempozan-Ferris-Wheel.jpg" alt="Tempozan Ferris Wheel" width="700" height="444" /><br />
The ferris wheel is a popular tourist attraction and dating spot! It&#8217;s located in Osaka Bay not far from Universal Studios, and the 15-minute ride is well worth it. The panoramic views of the city and the harbor is beautiful, and it&#8217;s particular popular in the evening where people enjoy the views of the city lights.</p>
<p><strong>07. Namba Parks</strong><br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3889" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Namba-Parks.jpg" alt="Namba Parks" width="700" height="449" /><br />
Namba and Shinsaibashi is a paradise for shoppers and one the more recently developed shopping complexes are Namba Parks. It differs from other shopping complexes in the sense that it is built around a green concept with roof top gardens and individual vegetable gardens. It boats quite a lot of Asian and Italian restaurants as well as a variety of fashion brands.</p>
<p>you can also visit the nearby shopping complexes of NAMBA CITY, NAMBA WALK, NAMBA NANNAN and EBISUBASHI-SUJI shopping arcade.</p>
<p><strong>08. HEP FIVE shopping &amp; entertainment complex</strong><br />

The Hep Five complex is located in Umeda and is a huge shopping and entertainment complex consisting of various food outlets and amusement areas such as pachinko and gaming lounges.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Norway is beautiful. With a stunningly grand scale and extremely scenic landscapes with snow-capped mountains, crystal clear waters, well-maintained roads with no traffic &amp; great outdoors for almost any kind of sports and outdoor activities. You have the freedom to pitch a tent almost anywhere, and pretty much everywhere you go you have it all to yourself. There is just one thing to take note of, it is expensive, I mean not just a little bit but REALLY! Anyway Norway&#8217;s beauty is sure worth every penny, and it&#8217;s one of my favorite places, but do make sure that you are prepared so your pocket doesn&#8217;t hurt too much. The amazing landscapes and fjords such as Sognefjord and Geiranger are absolutely spectacular, so if you are thinking of heading up there, here&#8217;s a bit of an introduction to get you started.<br />
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Norway.jpg" alt="Norway" width="741" height="486" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3883" /><br />
<strong>Where to Start &#8211; Hop on the Oslo Ferry</strong></p>
<p>A great way to embark on your Norwegian journey would be to start out in the capital of Oslo. If you are travelling Scandinavia one way of getting to Oslo would be via the Oslo ferry from Copenhagen, Denmark. It&#8217;s not just a ferry ride but more like a mini cruise, as it&#8217;s an overnight journey, and there&#8217;s lots to enjoy on board. It runs daily departing from Copenhagen late afternoon and arrives into Oslo harbour roughly around 9-10am the following day. The most scenic part of the trip is sailing through the Oslo fjord which is beautiful. So it&#8217;s well worth getting up early and investing in the enormous buffet breakfast, which you can enjoy while sailing through the tranquil setting of the Oslo fjord.</p>
<p>So now if using Oslo as a starting how to get to Sognefjord? A great way to drive is to go via Aurdal &#8211; Lom &#8211; Laerdal &#8211; Sogndalsfjora to the famous Sognefjord. You may detour via Lillehammer (making the journey a lot longer, but also well worth it) and have a look around the Olympic areas.</p>
<p><strong>The famous Sognefjord</strong></p>
<p>The Sognefjord is absolutely beautiful and I can highly recommend hopping on one of tour boats, and do a couple of hours of sailing, or doing a longer trip on the bigger cruise ships. The fjord is surely amazing to look at from above, but it gives a different perspective to look up! For trips and cruises you can check out Fjord Cruises and Norway&#8217;s famous ferry route Hurtigruten.</p>
<p><strong>Geirangerfjord</strong></p>
<p>Geiranger is another famous destination and even though it&#8217;s a popular tourist spot, it doesn&#8217;t seem crazy busy at all. In peak season (July &#8211; Aug) hotel rooms and huts can be in high demand, so its always a good idea to confirm your bookings ahead of time. If you are more into camping then yes Norway is the perfect place for that! Just pick a spot and you are free to set up camp almost anywhere. If you&#8217;d like something in between then renting a basic hut is a good option, and there&#8217;s quite a few to choose from all with spectacular views. Most campsites around Geiranger has huts as well, here&#8217;s the million dollar view from one of them!!</p>
<p><strong>Traditional Stave Churches</strong></p>
<p>Of course when traveling Norway one can&#8217;t forget about the beautiful stave Churces which dates back to between AD 1100 &#8211; 1200. Borgund stave church in Laerdal and Lom stave church in Lom is well worth a visit.</p>
<p><strong>When Is It Best To Go?</strong></p>
<p>Guess it depends if you are after skiing or hiking&#8230;The summer is short in Norway and even in peak the weather can change rapidly, so you always need to carry warm clothes with you. Nothing is ever guaranteed with Scandinavian summers, but when they do come it truly is amazing. You&#8217;ll have roughly 20 hours of sunlight during the Norwegian summer months, so there&#8217;s not much need of a torch! Summer is from June &#8211; August and is definitely the best season for camping and hiking. The autumn months of Sept-Oct are beautiful too, but it gets a fair bit cooler though. So the first few months of spring (March-May) are still very cold with snow on the mountains, so good for skiing!. It starts to warm up a little in late April making May the most comfortable month to travel in spring. Winter is cold&#8230;naturally! Of course if you are going skiing it&#8217;s the perfect season. Snow from Nov &#8211; April. Best months late Jan &#8211; March, just try to stay clear of week 7 (February) as it&#8217;s common to have school holidays in Scandinavia around that time, so everything costs double and you definitely won&#8217;t have it to yourself.</p>
<p>Anyway Norway is great place &#8211; so get out there and enjoy it!		</p>
