<p>Bewitching and besotted with beauty, <a href="https://www.namasteindiatrip.com/blog/hampi-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hampi in Karnataka</a> might be a small town but is easily one of the most magical tourist destinations in India. Among the many historical places that south India sits buoyant in, Hampi is diversive as well because of its offbeat vibe. Be it the burgeoning grandeur of the boulders or the tinkling bells of the numerous temples, Hampi never fails to fascinate. There’s always so much of history to unearth in this town that is home to the Hampi Group of Monuments, one of India’s many UNESCO World Heritage Sites.</p>
<p>In finding mention in such epics and scriptures as the Ramayana and the Puranas, Hampi establishes credibility as quite an ancient city. As also a part of the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire during the 14th century, Hampi makes its historical lineage all the more apparent. Even when it was in ruins, Hampi has stirred interest of archaeologists and historians and continues to entice tourists with its long standing legacy and of course its laidback yet sprightly way of life.</p>
<p>Hampi’s Riverside Ruins are particularly popular and so are its many temples. There also is the iconic King’s Balance beckoning with its own aura of history even as Hampi’s royal enclosure, the Elephant Stables and the zenana unfold a different world in time altogether before you. Equally captivating is the striking graffiti the town sports all around even as its many lush green rice fields and its pristine beauty makes Hampi a delight for all kinds of travelers and tourists. In its esteemed history and ethereal beauty, Hampi is no less than a wandering heaven.</p>

<p>In serving as the capital city for the Kingdom of Mysore for six centuries, Mysore immediately asserts its legacy as a place resplendent in its historical past.

Most famous for its royal Mysore Palace which also is one of the most beautiful palaces in India and among the most visited tourist destinations in the country, the city is celebrated in being the Palace City of India. That itself is a definite testament to its historical stemmings, when erstwhile royalty endowed Mysore the heritage making it among the most regal places in south India.

<p>Mahabalipuram, literally translating as the city of great power is also one residing in great richness of its history.

In its economic flourish as well as in its prized possession of the group of monuments carved out of living rock, Mahabalipuram has always been a seat of tremendous significance. The Seven Pagodas of Mahabalipuram of the ancient times had been as discreet a marker of the city’s identity as its present day heritage monuments.
