Geographically Sri Lanka is a gifted island nation and is a treat for all the wanderlust souls. Due to its unique location, the climate of the island is characterized as tropical. For this reason, Sri Lanka can be easily one of those rare holiday destinations in the world that can be visited all year round. Being surrounded by the ocean on all sides and blessed with an extensive coastline, the Sri Lankan weather system is a combination of many different types of conditions. Since the temperature remains fairly constant throughout the year, this land of tea and spices can be your go-to holiday destination.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>When Is The Best Time To Travel To Sri Lanka?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Even though Sri Lanka can be traveled throughout the year, there is a period when Sri Lanka is best experienced in its full glory. The best time to visit Sri Lanka is from December to mid-April. This is also considered as the peak travel season in the country when the tourists flock to the country from all over the world. However, if you are looking for good deals on hotel bookings and plane prices, then the shoulder season is also a good time. This will ensure good weather and lower visitors.<\/p>\n<p>Summer holidays are another popular period for travelers to flock to the island nation for a good time. During this time, the East Coast expects the perfect holiday-friendly weather accompanied by tons of sunny days. At the same time, the southwest monsoon leaves much of the south and west coast of the island with high rainfalls and gusty winds.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Summer in Sri Lanka<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>June to August are the summer months in Sri Lanka. This is the time when the southwestern monsoon covers the region with refreshing bouts of rain. Several hours of the day witness plenty of rainfall which is a delightful experience. The rainfall generally starts during sunset and goes on through the night. By morning the streets are dry again for you to enjoy a refreshing day out. The temperature remains between 32 to 36 Degree Celsius and the humidity might be bothersome. Sadly this is also the time when the southern coast of Sri Lanka experiences devastating hurricanes so always check the local news before heading out.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Monsoon in Sri Lanka<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The lengthy period of May to December marks the monsoon or the rainy months in Sri Lanka. During May the southwestern region of the island falls under the influence of the southwestern monsoon. However, the northeastern region of the island is well protected by mountainous terrain so the weather remains quite pleasant in these parts. The average temperature remains at a constant of 30 Degrees Celsius throughout the whole region.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Autumn in Sri Lanka<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The autumn season from September to November is relatively a calmer period for Sri Lanka. Monsoon showers take a turn and make way for something called the zenithal rains. They are less intense than the actual rain showers and generally start at noon. November brings a seasonal shift of winds in the region. The northeast monsoon brings forth the humid air masses from the Bay of Bengal and the central highland slopes finally receive their share of precipitation. The southwestern part of the island nation remains untouched and well-protected by the mountains. November is also a major tourist season for Sri Lanka. Even though the weather is hot the overall humidity remains at a moderate level. This makes traveling around the island extremely comfortable.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Winter in Sri Lanka<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Being a tropical country, the winter season in Sri Lanka lasts for a limited duration of just three months i.e. from January to April. This is another period to go on a memorable vacation. The average daily temperature does not rise above 28 degrees Celsius and the sun shines down throughout the day. Even though some scattered rains may fall, they are very quick and just occasional and generally don&#8217;t last longer than half an hour.<\/p>\n<p>Compared to the rainy season, the winter period on the island is dry. The ocean is also in a relatively calmer state so the tourists can easily go for a quick swim session. The nighttime is an absolute bliss where the temperature drops well below 24 degrees Celsius accompanied by cooling and refreshing wind.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Best Beach Weather in Sri Lanka<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Let us start by dividing the Sri Lankan coasts into three definite sections:<\/p>\n<p>The southwestern and south coast &#8211; the best times to explore the beaches of Negombo and Colombo are from December to March. October, November, and April are mid-season with May to September marking the monsoon months.<\/p>\n<p>East Coast &#8211; the peak beach season on the east coast of Sri Lanka is from April to September with October being the mid-season. November to March marks the monsoon season in these parts.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Sri Lanka\u2019s Weather by Region<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>To help you understand the weather system of the island and plan your trip better here is detailed information on the region-wise weather conditions:<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Colombo and South West Coast<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Famous tourist spots in these parts include Bentota, Colombo, Negombo, and Kalpitiya among others. The dry season in these parts is from December to March with the monsoon setting in from May and continuing till September. The West Coast\u2019s weather is governed by the southwestern monsoon so the best time to enjoy and get the most of these parts is from late November to April. Rainfall is the highest from June to September.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>The South Coast<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Galle, Weligama, Mirissa, Tangalle, Yala National Park, etc are a few of the most popular tourist attractions on the south coast of the island. The beaches from Galle to Mawella and Hambantota that make up the southern coast experience the best weather conditions for tourists from November to April. If you decide to head beyond Yala National Park anytime from October to January you may experience heavy rainy conditions. Much drier weather is expected from May to September.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Central and Northern Sections of the West Coast<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Some of the top tourist destinations of Kalpitiya, Puttalam, Mannar, etc make up the central and northern parts of the western coast of Sri Lanka. This part of the coastline experiences very different types of weather conditions as compared to the beach section and southern towns like Negombo. During the summer months from June to October the winds and sea remain high and don&#8217;t rain. Tourists can witness kite surfers and windsurfers taking advantage of the windy situation on the beaches of Kalpitiya.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>The Spiritual Trail Region<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Several of Sri Lanka\u2019s cultural centers and UNESCO World Heritage sites like Anuradhapura, Dambulla, and Sigiriya are placed within the dry zone of the region. Other than the high rainfall in November and December, the weather conditions remain somewhat arid throughout the year.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Kandy and Tea Plantation Regions<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The parts of Kandy, Ella, Nuwara Eliya, Hatton, and Adam\u2019s Peak make up some of the famous tea plantation regions in the country. Kandy is one place that occurs on the far lower side of the tea country and because of this, this place experiences higher temperatures and lower rainfall as compared to the hills of the south. The journey from Kandy to the central triangle part of the country takes the visitor high on an elevation of 700 meters. As you climb up you will experience a temperature drop. The climatic conditions are influenced heavily by both the monsoons and remind the visitors of a typical Scottish autumn season. These regions are relatively much cooler as compared to other parts of the country since it is placed on an elevation of 2,000 meters above sea level.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Suggested Tours<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/srilanka-tour-packages\"><strong>Sri Lanka Tour Packages<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/sri-lanka-honeymoon-tour.html\"><strong>Sri Lanka Honeymoon Tour Package<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/sri-lanka-ramayana-tour\"><strong>Sri Lanka Ramayana Tour Package<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/sri-lanka-heritage-tour.html\"><strong>Sri Lanka Heritage Tour Package<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/fascinating-sri-lanka\"><strong>Fascinating Sri Lanka Tour Package<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cmsmasters_column one_fourth\">\n<div class=\"cmsmasters_contact_form\">\n<div class=\"wpcf7 no-js\" id=\"wpcf7-f26619-o1\" lang=\"en-US\" dir=\"ltr\" data-wpcf7-id=\"26619\">\n<div class=\"screen-reader-response\"><p role=\"status\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><\/p> <ul><\/ul><\/div>\n<form action=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/35894#wpcf7-f26619-o1\" method=\"post\" class=\"wpcf7-form init\" aria-label=\"Contact form\" novalidate=\"novalidate\" data-status=\"init\">\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7\" value=\"26619\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_version\" value=\"6.0\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_locale\" value=\"en_US\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_unit_tag\" value=\"wpcf7-f26619-o1\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_container_post\" value=\"0\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_posted_data_hash\" value=\"\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"sidFrm\" class=\"pricBxt\">\n\t<div class=\"ratBxt\">\n\t\t<p>Get a Best Deal Quick Enquiry\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"itenBxt\">\n\t\t<p><span id=\"wpcf7-673c3cae4cb03-wrapper\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap website_fill-wrap\" style=\"display:none !important;
