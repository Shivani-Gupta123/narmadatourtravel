The entire state is divided among the lively and happening North Goa and the peaceful, serene South Goa. But one thing is common between both sides, no dearth of awesome, fun, relaxing, and sandy beaches.<\/p>\n<p>Goa is the ultimate beach destination for Indians right now but it has attracted foreign tourists for a very long time back for its spiritual and mystical aura. If you are planning on visiting Goa for your honeymoon or just to hang out, then these are some of the best beaches:<\/p>\n<h2><strong>List of 9 Best Beaches in Goa for Family<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong>1. Colva Beach<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Colva beach is one of the most popular beaches in Goa among Indian and foreign tourists. There are a plethora of activities any beachgoer can indulge in like jet skiing and parasailing. There are many homestay options here around the beach and some places like the lady of mercy church and an old house that has a statue of infant Jesus with healing powers. People here chill out by the beach, relax for some time, go check out the nearby places of tourist interest and create a lot of memories.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Morjim Beach<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Line by beach huts and sunbeds, Morjim Beach is located in the northern end of Goa and offers a very rustic feel. Due to the huge influx of Russian tourists, this place has now been given the nickname of little Russia. This beach is unlike any other beach in the entire state as it co-exists very peacefully with the beautiful fauna collection. You can check out the wildlife here like olive Ridley Turtles, kingfishers, cuckoo, sand plovers, and many more. The beach allows you to just sit back, relax and check out the beautiful beach nature unfolding in front of your eyes.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Dona Paula Beach<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Dona Paula is a lover\u2019s paradise and every honeymoon couples must-visit coastal destination located in Panaji. This beach has a very interesting love legend attached to it that sets the tone for the whole beach. The beach is named after the daughter of the viceroy of Goa who had thrown herself into the water of this beach when her father had forbidden her love for a local Goan fisherman. The beach was named after her because she was loved by the villagers for her loving and giving nature.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. Vagator Beach<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Vagator is one of the most lively and happening beaches in Goa but when compared to its neighbor beach of Arambol it is relatively calmer and serene. There are numerous high-end and top-notch restaurants, cafes, and eateries that offer scenic views of the never-ending beach, as far as the eyes can see. You can enjoy the sand and surf culture here while also shopping for souvenirs and chilling at the shacks. Vagator has to be undeniably Goa\u2019s most exquisite and pretty beach and a short walk to Chapora Fort will make the whole experience even more worth it.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5. Palolem Beach<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Palolem has to be the quirkiest beach in Goa. During the peak tourist season, the hospitality industry set up coco huts and tents allowing the visitors to spend a night on the beach and experience the sand and beach life. The rooms are rustic and offer the perfect vibe to meet your quirky soul. There are dedicated lounge chairs laid out for the comfort of the visitors that also adds a sense of relaxation to the whole environment. You can go for beach yoga, eat at well-reputed restaurants and cafes and also attend the silent beach disco.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>6. Galgibaga Beach<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This is one of the most lesser-known beaches of Goa that has managed to stay out of the constant commercialization and spotlight. Since it is away from tourism, Galgibaga remains one of the cleanest beaches in Goa. You can go there, pack a picnic, relax by the beach, and walk into the shallow clear waters for a quick swim. The protected area is home to tiny turtles which has also earned it the name of turtle beach. People spot olive ridley turtles all over this beach during the months of December to February. The caramel-colored beach sand and groves of tropical coconut palm trees makes this place a must-visit among all.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>7. Calangute Beach<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you are looking for the ultimate, quintessential, Goan beach experience, then Calangute or the queen of beaches is just the place for you. With lounge chairs, the never-ending sunshine galore, and the shacks offering delicious food and drinks, it is a great place for real tourists to interact with fellow travelers or just have a fun time with your family and loved ones. Being popular it is home to some of the most incredible water sports like sailing, banana boat riding, and dolphin watching. Calangute&#8217;s main attraction remains the St. Alex church that has attracted visitors since the 1600s.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>8. Benaulim Beach<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Benaulim beach is often referred to as the best beach for families and kids to have a great and memorable time. Located in the southern side of the famous Colva Beach, this beach offers a laid-back atmosphere and is the best place for people who are looking to get away from the typical, loud Goan party scene. This beach is all about sandy soft white sand and a great place for youngsters looking for some water sports activities along with some peace. It has jet skiing and sailing options while you can also sit back and just make sandcastles.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>9. Arambol Beach<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Arambol was once just a forgotten untouched fishing village on the coast of Goa. However, with the advent of backpacking over the years, it has become a hub or a mecca of backpackers and free spirit adventure lovers. Sitting by the beach and enjoying your day seems to be one of the best things to do here. There are tons of soulful activities for people to indulge in here like guided meditation, tai chi practices, and yoga classes. The sound of the waves crashing on the shore sits perfectly with the night drum circle and reiki sessions.<\/p>\n<p>Goa is all about the beauty of the beaches. Here are some other beaches that you can visit like Agonda, Candolim, and Anjuna and Butterfly beach.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Suggested Tours<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a
