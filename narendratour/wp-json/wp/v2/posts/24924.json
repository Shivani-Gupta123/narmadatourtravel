However, while traveling in Assam it is important to take away some souvenirs or memorabilia from here. Even if you are not someone who loves shopping or is looking forward to it, there is still a certain level of thrill when it comes to such stuff. Especially because not only do the local artisan\u2019s livelihood depend on them but also that they are so special in their own way, not factory produced, ensuring that these souvenirs and tokens of travel are super special and cannot be replicated anywhere else in the world.<\/p>\n<p>While shopping in Assam remember such unique pieces of art and craftworks or clothing items as well. It is also kind of exciting to research about the kind of things any place has to offer prior to going there in order to look forward to their vacation anywhere. Other than sightseeing and indulging in other fun tourist activities in Assam shopping there adds a special hint of fun in the holidays.<\/p>\n<p>If you are wondering where and what to buy then let us help you out. Let\u2019s start off by talking about what would be the best buy for your holiday in Assam to take back to your home or gift it to your close and loved ones:<\/p>\n<h2><strong>List of 12 Shopping Markets in Assam<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong>Tea Leaves<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Assamese tea is probably what has put this state on the map. While visiting one of the many rolling green tea plantation-covered landscapes, make sure to get yourself a package of pure, organic, homegrown tea leaves. In fact, one of the most important aspects is that Assam is one of those rare places where tea leaves are grown and harvested on the plains rather than hills. Not just the plantations, tea leaves are widely present in any of the local marketplaces. Did you know that Assam is the largest tea-producing state in India? So buying tea leaves should be a must!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Assam Silk<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Although the tea leaves popularity overshadows any other aspect of Assam, Assamese silk is another one of the most beloved productions in this wonderful hill state. Assam may not be your first preference to get your silk products, but this underrated state produces one of the finest qualities of silk in the market. The 3 main types of silk found here are Eri Silk, Muga, and pat. Muga silk has to be one of the most used silk types for producing local apparel for the people residing there.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Handicrafts Items<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you visit Assam and leave without buying a huge selection of handicrafts items, then your complete Assam experience remains incomplete. After all the handicrafts and handloom industry is what sets this humble and quaint state apart from the rest. Guwahati in Assam is the hub for all the northeastern states of India meaning they have the capacity to produce some of the most vivid handmade crafts items. You will find several bamboo and wood artifacts that are handmade by different tribes residing in the place. Other handicrafts items that may interest you are &#8211; bamboo cane products, jewelry, traditional paintings, toys, terracotta items and so much more.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Jaapi and Wooden Rhino Statues<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Jaapi is a traditional funnel-shaped hat that is produced mainly in Assam. This hat is symbolic of traditional Assamese culture and is worn with every performance of Bihu dance along with transitional clothing. It is symbolic of respecting other people&#8217;s rituals and even sometimes putting it in your house as a decorative item. Small wooden rhino statues are found everywhere in souvenirs shops in Assam because as you may already know that Kaziranga National Park is the only place where you can find this mammal, making it extra special.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Traditional Masks<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Also known as Mukhas, traditional masks created in Assam are famous all over the world for its unique bold and bright combination of colors, unique and diverse patterns, and massive shapes and sizes.
