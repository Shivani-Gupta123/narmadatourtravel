Devotees buy these cans to fill them up with the holy water and take it back to their homes. If you are coming from a distant place then go for small cooper cans that are nicely packed to prevent any leakage.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Lal Pedha<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Dharwad Pedha and Mathura Pedha are believed to be the two types of Pedhas that dominate South and North India respectively. Varanasi is very much famous for selling sweets and Lal Pedha, the more roasted version of the Pedhas. The sweet is stuffed with dry fruits and loaded with ghee and this gives it a crunchy flavor. Try buying it from the shop near Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple or the sweet shops of Kachori Gali.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Crystal and Stone Shivalinga<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The moment you share about your <strong>Varanasi trip<\/strong> with your family, friends, or near and dear ones they will ask you to pick up a crystal Shivalinga or Sphatika. These transparent white Shivalingas are made up of crystal and Hindus keep it in their homes to worship and even some people keep it in their bags for good luck. These Shivalingas are found in different sizes and the smallest one costs you around 100.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Rudraksha Mala<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The textured seed of the Rudraksha tree is believed to be the most organic jewelry that the saints have been wearing from time immemorial. Rudraksha happens to be the earlier form of Shiva and means tear of Lord Rudra and is believed to be a very spiritual seed that is worn with a lot of devotion and faith. Do not forget to take it off when you go to the washroom or any unclean or impure places.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Brassware<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The city is pretty reckoned for an array of clay, brass, and copperware products that are generally used on some special occasions like puja rituals. The brass water pot or the \u201cKamandal\u201d is a favorite pick amongst other products made of brass. If you are also interested to purchase it then visit the areas near temples where the shops are lined up with such products.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Gulabi Minakari<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The hidden or lesser-known craft of Varanasi, Gulabi Minakari is a carving done on precious metals like silver and gold. The silverwork generally happens in western India- Gujarat, and Rajasthan.
