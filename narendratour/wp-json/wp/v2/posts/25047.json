This industrial city of Gujarat is reckoned for its warm hospitality and kind-hearted people and the locals here are very fond of eating. One can find a number of roadside food installments and world-class restaurants in the city.<\/p>\n<p>The city is home to several parks, museums, educational institutions, temples, and happens to be a financial hub. This gastronomic paradise attracts thousands of travelers from all across the globe every year. Khakhra, Fafda, Thepla, Patra, Dalvada Undhiyo, Khaman- Dhokla, etc. are a few of the most popular heavy-sounding Gujju snacks and this list goes on. Gujarati people are ardent lovers of food and they never compromise with their taste buds.<\/p>\n<p>We bring you a list of must-try delicacies when it comes to savor the most loved food items in Ahmedabad.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>List of Most Delicious Food in Ahmedabad to Try<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong>Indu Ben Ka Khakhra<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Although you can find this mouth-watering snack at almost every roadside stall and restaurant the one that you find at Indu Ben Shop is incredible. Besides serving you this white crispy delicacy, the shop also offers you some other exciting snack options that are pretty hard to resist such as Fafdas, Namkeen, Papad, Khakhra, Chutney, and Mukhwas. The shop is famous among the locals and tourists for its spicy, delicious, and delicate preparations.<\/p>\n<p>This is quite a simply prepared food item cooked with wheat flour, spices, salt, and edible oil. There are almost hundreds of varieties in Khakhra based on the spices you add to the wheat flour base, so select the variant of your choice and treat your taste bud with this relishing snack.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Asharfi Ni Kulfi<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>They claim themselves to be the \u2018King of cool Kulfi\u2019 and there is nothing to oppose their claim. This shop in Ahmedabad is quite famous for its mouth-watering and scrumptious Kulfis available in multiple flavors. Do binge on these delicious condensed milk frozen desserts to give a perfect finishing to your hearty meal. These delectable Kulfis are prepared with evaporated milk solids or Khoya and are then added with thickened milk. Flavors like nuts, cardamom, saffron, and sugar are used as toppings to add more flavor.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Samosa Pav<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The list of Indian street food is always incomplete without Samosa, a deep-fried savory prepared with white flour, potato, onion, and other ingredients. This cone-shaped snack is usually served with two chutneys- sweet sauce and coriander chutney but I personally like to taste it with red chutney. Samosa Pav is a very quick and easily prepared snack by sandwiching scrumptious Samosa inside a Pav or bun and is served with tomato ketchup and spicy chutney.<\/p>\n<p>The dash of cheese and spice-mix on both sides of the bun add more point to its flavor and makes it hard to resist even for a health-conscious individual.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Fafda Jalebi<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>A plate of the mouth-watering eatery was prepared using two different snack items- Fafda and Jalebi. This platter is generally enjoyed as a morning meal served with salad and green chilly. This famous breakfast item in Ahmedabad gives a perfect start to your day with a mix of sweet and spicy flavors to the taste buds. Fafda is cooked with gram flour and spice-mixed dough and then fried as chips like snacks.<\/p>\n<p>Jalebi is prepared with all-purpose flour and gram flour batter which is then friend into rings and then dipped in tangy sugar syrup. Depending on your taste preference you can either one of them or club them together.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Dhokla<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Dhokla, a steamed fluffy chickpea cake is a dish that comes to everyone\u2019s mind when speaking of Gujarati cuisine. This light dish is prepared with chickpea flour, salt, sugar, spice, and a dash of baking soda to provide a soft and rising texture to the cake. Dhokla is both sweet and salty in taste and is served with red chilly chutney and green coriander chutney.<\/p>\n<p>It is something that you must try on your holiday in Ahmedabad as you can get in anytime and anywhere. The best thing is that it is very mild on the tummy hence, no need to worry about improper Digestion.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Pani Puri or Golgappa<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>None of the celebrations in our country goes without tasting these crunchy balls of irresistible flavor and joy. The Puri of this snack looks like a ping pong ball and Pani means water added with different ingredients. The crunchy balls are first stuffed with smashed potatoes and sprouts and then filled with tangy and flavored water.<\/p>\n<p>The tangy water is prepared with coriander leaves, Red Chilli Powder, Salt, Green Chilli, and tamarind juice. Put that stuffed crunchy ball infused filled with water into your mouth and enjoy the infusion of spicy stuffing and flavored water and enjoy the heavenly feeling.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bhuna Gosht<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Gujaratis are known for serving vegetarian dishes on their platter but if you are a non-vegetarian person then also you don\u2019t need to worry as non-vegetarian delights are equally popular. Bhuna Gosht is one of the most liked and savored delicacies that is cooked in spicy gravy made of onions and tomatoes. The preparation of this spicy dish consists of small pieces of mutton and the juices of tomatoes and onions are mixed well with that of the mutton.<\/p>\n<p>The lamb meat gets prepared in this juice and turns into a velvety-soft semi-dry gravy that is usually served with Paranthas and with plain white rice or biryani. Ahmedabad Bhuna Gosht is a must-try delicacy for all non-vegetarian food lovers.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Mutton Chaap<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Mutton Chaap is another must-try non-vegetarian eatery that can be prepared in two variants fried dry snack or a gravy-rich dish served with roti\/Paratha\/ rice. Refrigerated mutton ribs in a marinade made of mace powder, ginger garlic paste, curd, and salt are used to prepare this lip-smacking delicacy. The prepared marinade is first taken in the fridge for almost 2 or more hours before being taken out to prepare the dish.<\/p>\n<p>To achieve proper consistency of gravy, the chef and the locals add onions, tomatoes, and a proper amount of every spice.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Bhel Puri<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This puffed rice snack is a delectable snack that is sometimes enjoyed as a mild dinner by the Amdavadis. This delicious snack gives out a variety of flavors such as spicy, tangy, and sweet. It tastes best when you have it just after it is served to you and this is why the vendors prepare Bhelpuri only after your order for it. The best thing is that it takes only two minutes to prepare this crispy, yummy, and lip-smacking Eatery.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Batata Poha<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Also called Potato Poha, this yummy street food is cooked with flattened rice, ginger, chilly, onion, potato, and seasoning. Roasted peanuts, curry leaves, cumin, mustard, coriander leaves, and asafetida are used as a seasoning to prepare this delicacy. This is a simple yet very fulfilling dish offered in Ahmedabad. All the green vegetables and seasoning are sauteed along in the oil and then the soaked flattened rice is added to the mixture. Poha when blended well with the vegetables, spices, salt, and other ingredients offer an irresistible taste. One can enjoy this snack either with green chilly or with plain curd.<\/p>\n<p>Loaded with variant flavors, textures, and spices, Ahmedabad street food is something that one must not miss on their trip to Ahmedabad. The aroma of the eateries prepared in the city is so generous and tempting that it becomes hard to resist even if you are not hungry. The list of must-try food items in Ahmedabad doesn\u2019t end here and we have compiled only a few of them.<\/p>\n<p>If you are excited to know about more such snacks or dishes then do share and like this post and motivate us to bring more such articles for you.
