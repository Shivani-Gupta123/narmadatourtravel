Established in the Indo-Gangetic plains, this spiritual city has attracted many settlers, traders, and rulers for centuries. This ancient city has been mentioned in inscriptions and literature going back to prehistoric times and is home to numerous monuments that were constructed several centuries ago but are still standing gracefully.<\/p>\n<p>Agra tourism is something that doesn\u2019t require any sort of introduction and a huge number of foreign travelers explore this city to experience the sublime beauty and serenity spread everywhere. This beautiful city in Uttar Pradesh is nicely connected with many other major cities of the country by a great network of buses, trains, and flights. Jet Airways, Indigo, Spicejet, and Go Air are some of the major operating domestic airlines.<\/p>\n<p>British Airways, Etihad Airways, Emirates, etc. are a few major international airlines operating the flights.<\/p>\n<p>Indira Gandhi Airport in New Delhi is the nearest airport (located at a distance of a total of 220 km) to the city. Agra Fort Railway Station and Agra Cantt are the two major railheads serving the city. Also, traveling to Agra by roadways is the easiest and the most convenient way to reach the place.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Reaching Agra by Air<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>However, the city has its own airport but it is not well connected to other cities, hence, Indira Gandhi Airport in New Delhi is believed to be the closest airport to Agra.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Reaching Agra by Rail<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>As stated above there are two railheads in the city but Agra Cantt happens to be the main railway station in Agra. This railway station is established in the southwest of Agra Fort and Taj Mahal. After coming out of the railway station hire a taxi or catch an auto to reach both Agra Fort and Taj Mahal. Agra Fort Railway is considered to be one of the oldest railway stations in India from where you can watch trains to different places.<\/p>\n<p>Trains from eastern cities including Patna, Gorakhpur, Kanpur, Kolkata, and the cities of Central India like Billochpura, Raja Ki Mandi, Nagda, Ratlam, Yamuna Bridge, etc. are also connected with the city through the railhead. Royal Rajasthan and Palace on Wheels are some other fast-moving trains that have a stoppage in Agra.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Reaching Agra by Road<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Taj Depot, Ford Depot, Idgah Bus Stand, and Inter State Bus Terminal are some of the major bus stands in Agra that connect the place with several other nearby major cities of the country. NH11 connects Jaipur with Agra via Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary whereas NH2 connects Agra to Delhi via Tughlaqabad.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Reaching Agra by self-drive<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The city is well connected to Delhi via New Yamuna Expressway and it takes almost 4-5 hours to cover the distance between the cities. Similarly, you will have to cover a 4-5 hours long road journey if you are coming to Agra by your own vehicle. Gwalior, Kanpur, and Lucknow are other few cities from where you can come by driving on your own.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Top reasons to visit Agra<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>This hugely populated city in Uttar Pradesh is renowned for its ancient history and modern residences altogether that attracts many Indian as well as global tourists.

This fort has saved the city and its warriors from many battles and won against many attacks during the Mughal period. The construction of this ancient fort was finally during Shah Jahan\u2019s reign, the ruler of the third generation of the Mughal Empire. According to Indian history, the ruler had spent his old age imprisoned life at this place only.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Fatehpur Sikri &#8211; A miniature city<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This historical structure happens to be one of the most astonishing travel destinations in the city and is believed to be the very first architecture of the Mughal dynasty. Constructed with plenty of red sandstone, this miniature city is renowned as UNESCO World Heritage Site. This massive structure was the capital city of the Mughal Empire back during the sixteenth century. There are several other structures constructed inside this gorgeous palace.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Jama Masjid &#8211; Mosque inside the city of Fatehpur Sikri<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Some of the most popular and must-visit places in Agra, Jama Masjid is another popular place to visit inside this walled city. This ancient yet captivating mosque is the other popular construction by the ruler Shah Jahan for Jahanara, the eldest Daughter.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Panchhi Petha &#8211; A sweet dish in Agra<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>To add more flavors to your Agra city sightseeing tour you can enjoy binging on Panchhi Petha in the city. This sweet dish is cooked with a fruit named ash gourd and sugar. Whenever I plan my Agra tour, the very first thing my friends or relatives ask for is Agra Petha, the sweet famous all around the globe.
