Having colonized Goa for over 400 years their impressions remain embedded in Goa\u2019s buildings, food choices, and language up to some extent. However, before the colonization, Goa was the land of self-governing bodies, religious practices, and beliefs that were not met with confrontation and an attempt to eradicate them along with unity and a feeling of brotherhood and peace among everyone. There were fishing villages, rich heritage, and culture that majorly consisted of Hindus and other religions living in complete peace. They flourished and became the best shipbuilders in the world while also maintaining overseas foreign trade relations with other countries.
