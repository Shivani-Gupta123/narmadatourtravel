The Mall Road is a place where people can walk a mile to take in the aroma of tasty food and peruse the several shops in the vicinity that sell local products. In the evening, most of them prefer to take a boat ride on the serene Naini Lake enjoying the reflection of the hills on its reflecting waves. People, looking for some adventure, may decide to hike along one of the beautiful trails that meander across the region\u2019s hills. Some might want to spend some time in the legendary Naina Devi Temple, overlooking the northern side of the water, to get blessings and understand the calmness of the spirit.<\/p>\n<p>As the evening settles in, Nainital becomes a plethora of unforeseen opportunities to savour the local food at the quaint little eateries and restaurants spread across this town. Whether it is a hot plate of piping hot momos at Tibetan Market or a hearty traditional Kumaoni meal, there is something to tickle the taste buds of every traveller. Evenings are mostly spent in browsing through shops, buying handicrafts, and enjoying the street shows in Mall Road. Lastly, as the darkness falls, visitors retire to homely residences, amid hills, probably gulping a hot beverage of cocoa or chai while indulging in memories of the day\u2019s exploits, anxious to find tomorrow in Nainital.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>People of Nainital<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The people of Nainital are cordial and hospitable which presents the image of a friendly hill station.

They have occupied this place for centuries and dwell in the hills surrounded by little hut-shaped houses full of stones or red bricks with tin roofs.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Religious beliefs of Nainital<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>They are extremely pious and quite superstitious like the Black Kajal that they apply on their forehead to escape any evil and spirit. The Gods in Nainital include Lord Bholenath, Naina Devi, Gangnath, Nanda Devi, Kail Bisht, Sunanda Devi, Golu, Haru, Sam and Adi. They also practice \u2018Jaagar\u2019 &#8211; a form of calling on their gods and deities which is performed only on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Language of Nainital<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The main language spoken in Nainital is Hindi. On the other hand, the language structure of the region is also dominated by the presence of the Kumaoni language, which is native to the Kumaon region in Uttarakhand. As one of the regional languages used in the Indian state of Uttarakhand, Kumaoni is culturally significant alongside Garhwali, another vernacular tongue, found in family and community gatherings.

On special occasions, such as marriages or festivals, a woman wears a cloth known as Pichora or Rangwali. This material is approximately 3 meters long and 1.5 meters wide, yellow-dyed, and decorated with red patterns, such as Swastika, sun, moon, bell, and conch shell symbols.<\/p>\n<p>Women use rice paste mixed with ochre to decorate the floors and walls of their homes not only for festivals and ceremonies but also for making beautiful patterns. The flooring of the worship area and seats of Gods and Goddess are decorated by a special form of patterns called Peeth or Yantra that look like diagrams depicting the dwelling place of the deities.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, in the events of naming ceremonies, designs manifested on wooden seats show symbols such as the sun and moon. Seats at the wedding may feature designs that depict a large water jug, indicating the water from which the world originated. These traditions bring about colour and significance to major occurrences in the Kumaoni culture.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cmsmasters_column one_fourth\">\n<div class=\"cmsmasters_contact_form\">\n<div class=\"wpcf7 no-js\" id=\"wpcf7-f26619-o1\" lang=\"en-US\" dir=\"ltr\" data-wpcf7-id=\"26619\">\n<div class=\"screen-reader-response\"><p role=\"status\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><\/p> <ul><\/ul><\/div>\n<form action=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/37813#wpcf7-f26619-o1\" method=\"post\" class=\"wpcf7-form init\" aria-label=\"Contact form\" novalidate=\"novalidate\" data-status=\"init\">\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7\" value=\"26619\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_version\" value=\"6.0\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_locale\" value=\"en_US\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_unit_tag\" value=\"wpcf7-f26619-o1\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_container_post\" value=\"0\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_posted_data_hash\" value=\"\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"sidFrm\" class=\"pricBxt\">\n\t<div class=\"ratBxt\">\n\t\t<p>Get a Best Deal Quick Enquiry\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"itenBxt\">\n\t\t<p><span id=\"wpcf7-673c38909c4af-wrapper\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap website_fill-wrap\" style=\"display:none !important; visibility:hidden !important;\"><label for=\"wpcf7-673c38909c4af-field\" class=\"hp-message\">Please leave this field empty.<\/label><input id=\"wpcf7-673c38909c4af-field\"  class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text\" type=\"text\" name=\"website_fill\" value=\"\" size=\"40\" tabindex=\"-1\" autocomplete=\"new-password\" \/><\/span><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"your-name\"><input size=\"40\" maxlength=\"400\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text wpcf7-validates-as-required\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"Full Name*\" value=\"\" type=\"text\" name=\"your-name\" \/><\/span><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"your-email\"><input size=\"40\" maxlength=\"400\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-email wpcf7-validates-as-required wpcf7-text wpcf7-validates-as-email\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"Email Id*\" value=\"\" type=\"email\" name=\"your-email\" \/><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<p class=\"sCntry\"><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap your-country\"><input class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-intl_tel wpcf7-intl-tel\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"in\" data-initialcountry=\"in\" data-preferredcountries=\"gb-in\" value=\"\" type=\"tel\" name=\"your-country-cf7it-national\" \/><input name=\"your-country\" type=\"hidden\" class=\"wpcf7-intl-tel-full\" \/><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"your-country-cf7it-country-name\" class=\"wpcf7-intl-tel-country-name\" \/><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"your-country-cf7it-country-code\" class=\"wpcf7-intl-tel-country-code\" \/><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"your-country-cf7it-country-iso2\" class=\"wpcf7-intl-tel-country-iso2\" \/><\/span><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"your-phones\"><input size=\"40\" maxlength=\"400\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-tel wpcf7-validates-as-required wpcf7-text wpcf7-validates-as-tel\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"10 digit mobile number\" value=\"\" type=\"tel\" name=\"your-phones\" \/><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<p><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"your-date\"><input size=\"40\" maxlength=\"400\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text wpcf7-validates-as-required\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"Time of Travel*\" value=\"\" type=\"text\" name=\"your-date\" \/><\/span><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"your-trMess\"><textarea cols=\"40\" rows=\"10\" maxlength=\"140\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-textarea\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"Write a description of your tour so we can design the best package for you!\" name=\"your-trMess\"><\/textarea><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><button type=\"submit\" class=\"waves-bxt submitBtn2\">SEND ME DETAILS <i class=\"fa fa-arrow-circle-right\"><\/i><\/button><br \/>\n<span class=\"infoBxs\">We never share your Information.<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"wpcf7-response-output\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/div>\n<\/form>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"The culture of Nainital is colourful and varied.
