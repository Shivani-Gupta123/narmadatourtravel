The essence of Hrishikesh lay in its name &#8211; `Hrishik,&#8217; meaning feelings (sentiments), and &#8216;Esh,&#8217; lord or master. The stories of gods and sages colour every corner of Rishikesh.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Chronicles of Rishikesh<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The chronicles of history declared Hrishikesh as the oldest pilgrimage site, bound in its literature and soil. The very soil and water of this holy land are believed to have supernatural powers, intensified by the rigorous penance performed by sages who lived there as well as gods.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Let\u2019s know in detail about the History of Rishikesh<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Rishikesh: The Land of Sages<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Once upon a time, a Sage named Raibhya wanted to please and get the blessings of Lord Vishnu. So, he decided to perform a strict penance in the banks of Ganga. By hard penance, he overcame the weaknesses associated with the senses. Impressed by his devotion, Lord Vishnu appeared in front of him in the form of Hrishikesh \u2018Lord of the senses\u2019, and gave him blessings. The Sage requested him to make Hrishikesh his eternal home place. As the sage was devoted, Vishnu fulfilled his wish and anticipated years later when he would be known as Bharat in Kaliyug. The site on which this spiritual victory took place was recognized as Hrishikesh. Eventually, the pronunciation changed and it is now called Rishikesh.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The Tale of Agni Tirth<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Another story continued for centuries that spoke of a flame-throwing explosion that burned up Rishikesh. Thus, in his divine anger, Lord Shiva cursed Lord Agni, the god of fire for all transgressions. In search of redemption, Lord Agni prayed feverishly in Hrishikesh for the expiation of his sins. The land became a holy ground called the \u2018Agni Tirth\u2019 &#8211; a place for having sacraments by the Fire God.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Lord Vishnu\u2019s supremacy<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The sacred sanctuary of Rishikesh had become a haven for those looking to find peace. Rishikesh\u2019s verdant leaves murmured legends, and the Ganges River flowed softly like a hymn to God above. But there was one particular legend that is important to know, a story from the sacred shores of the Ganges about how God Vishnu bravely fought against Madhu-a frightening demon. The aftershocks of that heavenly confrontation still inhabited the atmosphere, indelibly stamping Hrishikesh in colours of divinity.<\/p>\n<p>While the timeless saga of Ramayana was in motion, the compassionate holiness that enveloped Hrishikesh disclosed itself even more. In his pursuit of righteousness, Lord Ram started a journey of penance to defeat Ravana &#8211; a demon king. The river Ganges flowed silently but could hear the resolute determination of Lord Ram in his quest to save Devi Sita.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Story of Laxman Jhula<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Have you heard about the story behind Laxman Jhula? The Laxman Jhula is a very popular hanging bridge that connects Tapovan in Tehri and Jonk in Pauri Garhwal. It is said that Lord Laxman crossed the river Ganga using a jute rope bridge at the same site where Laxman Jhula is located. The original bridge was replaced by an iron rope suspension bridge in 1889 and an exactly similar bridge was constructed in 1986 which is known as Ram Jhula.<\/p>\n<p>The Laxman Jhula saga displays the continuity of a narrative that related gods and mortals to one another.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Rishikesh in Medieval Times<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>However, in the medieval era, Hrishikesh was a sparsely populated place that received only during the pilgrim season. The atmosphere was replete with the chants of sages and verses by poets. The land was laced with bamboo shrubs and mango groves, as well as temples that served as testimony to the spiritual nature of the place. But the passage of time has posed challenges with floods in the Ganges, the iconoclasts, and earthquakes washing away traces of ancient constructions.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Rishikesh\u2019s Modern Charm<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Today this celestial city is a popular hub for Yoga, sports, and adventure lovers apart from being the holiest place for Hindus. Many locals as well as International tourists visit Rishikesh to dive deep into the spiritual realm as well as indulge in thrill activities. The town has beautifully managed to strike a delicate balance between modern development and natural charm. In Rishikesh, we see new-age wellness and yoga centres and the town\u2019s infrastructure development caters to the needs of modern travellers. The traditional charm of Rishikesh is still intact, and the holy river Ganges continues to flow serenely, inviting travellers from all across the globe. Indeed, it is a timeless destination for seeking tranquillity and excitement in the lap of the mighty Himalayas.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cmsmasters_column one_fourth\">\n<div class=\"cmsmasters_contact_form\">\n<div class=\"wpcf7 no-js\" id=\"wpcf7-f26619-o1\" lang=\"en-US\" dir=\"ltr\" data-wpcf7-id=\"26619\">\n<div class=\"screen-reader-response\"><p role=\"status\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><\/p> <ul><\/ul><\/div>\n<form action=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/37618#wpcf7-f26619-o1\" method=\"post\" class=\"wpcf7-form init\" aria-label=\"Contact form\" novalidate=\"novalidate\" data-status=\"init\">\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7\" value=\"26619\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_version\" value=\"6.0\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_locale\" value=\"en_US\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_unit_tag\" value=\"wpcf7-f26619-o1\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_container_post\" value=\"0\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_posted_data_hash\" value=\"\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"sidFrm\" class=\"pricBxt\">\n\t<div class=\"ratBxt\">\n\t\t<p>Get a Best Deal Quick Enquiry\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"itenBxt\">\n\t\t<p><span id=\"wpcf7-673c40100ae7f-wrapper\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap website_fill-wrap\" style=\"display:none !important; visibility:hidden !important;\"><label for=\"wpcf7-673c40100ae7f-field\" class=\"hp-message\">Please leave this field empty.<\/label><input id=\"wpcf7-673c40100ae7f-field\"  class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text\" type=\"text\" name=\"website_fill\" value=\"\" size=\"40\" tabindex=\"-1\" autocomplete=\"new-password\" \/><\/span><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"your-name\"><input size=\"40\" maxlength=\"400\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text wpcf7-validates-as-required\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"Full Name*\" value=\"\" type=\"text\" name=\"your-name\" \/><\/span><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"your-email\"><input size=\"40\" maxlength=\"400\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-email wpcf7-validates-as-required wpcf7-text wpcf7-validates-as-email\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"Email Id*\" value=\"\" type=\"email\" name=\"your-email\" \/><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<p class=\"sCntry\"><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap your-country\"><input class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-intl_tel wpcf7-intl-tel\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"in\" data-initialcountry=\"in\" data-preferredcountries=\"gb-in\" value=\"\" type=\"tel\" name=\"your-country-cf7it-national\" \/><input name=\"your-country\" type=\"hidden\" class=\"wpcf7-intl-tel-full\" \/><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"your-country-cf7it-country-name\" class=\"wpcf7-intl-tel-country-name\" \/><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"your-country-cf7it-country-code\" class=\"wpcf7-intl-tel-country-code\" \/><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"your-country-cf7it-country-iso2\" class=\"wpcf7-intl-tel-country-iso2\" \/><\/span><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"your-phones\"><input size=\"40\" maxlength=\"400\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-tel wpcf7-validates-as-required wpcf7-text wpcf7-validates-as-tel\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"10 digit mobile number\" value=\"\" type=\"tel\" name=\"your-phones\" \/><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<p><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"your-date\"><input size=\"40\" maxlength=\"400\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-text wpcf7-validates-as-required\" aria-required=\"true\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"Time of Travel*\" value=\"\" type=\"text\" name=\"your-date\" \/><\/span><span class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap\" data-name=\"your-trMess\"><textarea cols=\"40\" rows=\"10\" maxlength=\"140\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control wpcf7-textarea\" aria-invalid=\"false\" placeholder=\"Write a description of your tour so we can design the best package for you!\" name=\"your-trMess\"><\/textarea><\/span>\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<p><button type=\"submit\" class=\"waves-bxt submitBtn2\">SEND ME DETAILS <i class=\"fa fa-arrow-circle-right\"><\/i><\/button><br \/>\n<span class=\"infoBxs\">We never share your Information.<\/span>\n\t\t\t<\/p>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"wpcf7-response-output\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><\/div>\n<\/form>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Nestled between the towering Himalayan Mountains and the holy Ganges, the pious land named Hrishikesh has captivated every type of traveller for decades.
