However, there is a lot of interesting and dynamic historical account which has shaped up the current state. Did you know that it was not until 1950 that the state was carved out from Uttaranchal forming 2 separate states of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh? The region\u2019s history, however, can be further traced back to as far as 6,000 BC. Being placed by the holy 3 rivers of Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswat forming the Triveni Sangam to being the home of the 7th wonder of the world -Taj Mahal, this place holds a very significant position in case of religion. From being the home of the fertile Gangetic Plains to being the hometown and kingdom of the great hero of Hindu mythology, Ram, this state has a lot more to it than what meets the eyes.<\/p>\n<p>This state plays a major role in the formation of Indian history and showcases the number of dynasties and empires it was ruled by for its obvious benefits. It was here, in the eastern capital close to Delhi that the rulers would identify as the perfect place to form the seat of power and a vantage point for establishing control throughout the northern part of the subcontinent. Due to its age-old history UP has emerged as the 4th largest and the most populous state of India. It is bordered by Uttarakhand, Nepal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi making it a beautiful combination of different beliefs, traditions, and cultures.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from Hinduism, the birth of Buddhism is also a landmark historical event that has successfully formed the religious base of this place. As per sources, it was during the Aryan inhabitation that the iconic and legendary epics like Mahabharat, Ramayan, Puranas, etc were written which still holds a lot of significance in the Hindu religion. The foundation of civilization in Uttar Pradesh was laid by various different civilizations that had inhabited here like the people involved in the Mahabharata. Apart from this did you know that Lord Shri Krishna was born and stayed here for a while prior to shifting his kingdom and attention to Dwarka in Gujarat.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Mughal A Rule in UP<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>It was during the 16th century when Babur made his way from the Khyber Pass and established the Mughal rule in India. During the Mughal rule, Uttar Pradesh was considered to be the heartland of the Mughal Empire from where Humayun and Babur are to have ruled from. During the year 1540, Mughal ruler Humayun was defeated by Sher Shah Suri to gain control of UP with the capital being established at Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh. After the death of Suri, his Prime Minister Hemu became a de facto ruler before being defeated in the 2nd battle of Panipat by the Mughal king Akbar. His win was marked by the establishment of Fatehpur Sikri a brand new city commemorating his victory who was later on succeeded by his son Jahangir.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Geography of UP<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>UP is a massive state and shares its international boundary with Nepal along with being bordered with a number of other Indian \/ domestic states. Generally, it is entirely divided into 2 different regions depending on the altitude which are &#8211; the larger Gangetic plains that form the northern region of the state and the Ganga &#8211; Yamuna Doab region which is also named as the Terai region. The soil here is fertile and of alluvial nature which makes up for its flat land type. The southern part of the state consists of the smaller Vindhya ranges and the plateau region which is overall dotted with a number of ponds, lakes, streams, and rivers that contribute to making this place extremely fertile and rich with minerals. When it comes to weather conditions the place experiences a typical tropical climate where the summers are hot, dry and humid and winters are cool and bearable.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Division of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>It was during the British rule that the administrators and officials had recognized the fact that the people, tribes, and groups of the hills are very different in terms of traditions, beliefs, and customs. They created a separate administrative headquarter in the current region of Uttarakhand. It was not until 1979 that the famous Kranti Dal was formed with the founding members being Shri Indramani Badoni, Kasha Singh Airy, Bipin Chandra Tripathi among others. This was done entirely with the motive of preserving the Pahadi Identity. It was not until 2000 under the leadership of prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that the state of Uttar Pradesh was separated from the former state of Uttaranchal which also included Uttarakhand.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Facts about Uttar Pradesh<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>It is in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh that the largest religious gathering of people takes place in the iconic event known as the Mahakumbh Meal that takes place once in every 6 \/ 12 years.<\/li>\n<li>Uttar Pradesh has made its place as the world\u2019s most populous state apart from being the 4th most populous state in India. It follows China, India, Indonesia and USA.<\/li>\n<li>Some of the most iconic literary figures were born in UP, like Kabir Das, Tulsidas and Premchand among others.<\/li>\n<li>When it comes to tourism UP is not left behind since it ranks no.1 when it comes to receiving domestic tourists. It has recorded the arrival of over 71 million tourists domestically i.e. from different parts of India.<\/li>\n<li>A unique type of tree called Parijaat is said to have been brought down from heaven by Lord Krishna. The unique feature about this tree is the fact that its flowers keep changing Colours throughout the year and it cannot be found anywhere else.<\/li>\n<li>UP boasts of having one of the largest economies in India, 4th place to be precise with the agriculture and service sector contributing to a majority part of the economy.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Suggested Tours<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"\/uttar-pradesh-tour-packages\"><strong>Uttar Pradesh Tour Packages<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/uttar-pradesh-tour\"><strong>Best of Uttar Pradesh Tour<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/spiritual-uttar-pradesh\"><strong>Spiritual Uttar Pradesh Tour<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/allahabad-varanasi-tour\"><strong>Varanasi Allahabad Tour<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/varanasi-ayodhya-allahabad-tour.html\"><strong>Varanasi Allahabad Ayodhya Tour<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/varanasi-city-tour\"><strong>Varanasi Sightseeing Tour<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/allahabad-varanasi-puri-tour\"><strong>Allahabad Varanasi Puri Tour<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/varanasi-bodhgaya-chitrakoot-trip\"><strong>Varanasi Bodhgaya Chitrakoot Tour<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/ganges-northern-india\"><strong>Northern India Tour with Ganga Darshan<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/sangam-darshan\"><strong>Allahabad Sangam Tour<\/strong><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cmsmasters_column one_fourth sidefrBt\">\n<div class=\"cmsmasters_sidebar sidebar_layout_11\"><aside id=\"text-8\" class=\"widget widget_text\">\t\t\t<div class=\"textwidget\"><div class=\"sidefrBt\">\n\n<div class=\"wpcf7 no-js\" id=\"wpcf7-f26619-o1\" lang=\"en-US\" dir=\"ltr\" data-wpcf7-id=\"26619\">\n<div class=\"screen-reader-response\"><p role=\"status\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><\/p> <ul><\/ul><\/div>\n<form action=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/22836#wpcf7-f26619-o1\" method=\"post\" class=\"wpcf7-form init\" aria-label=\"Contact form\" novalidate=\"novalidate\" data-status=\"init\">\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7\" value=\"26619\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_version\" value=\"6.0\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_locale\" value=\"en_US\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_unit_tag\" value=\"wpcf7-f26619-o1\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_container_post\" value=\"0\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_posted_data_hash\" value=\"\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"sidFrm\" class=\"pricBxt\">\n\t<div class=\"ratBxt\">\n\t\t<p>Get a Best Deal Quick Enquiry\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"itenBxt\">\n\t\t<p><span id=\"wpcf7-673c3d27ea2fc-wrapper\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap website_fill-wrap\" style=\"display:none !important;
