During the struggling phase of Indian independence, the city served as the home to several prominent leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel.<\/p>\n<p>In the present day, Ahmedabad is crowned as the \u2018Manchester of India\u2019 because of its splendor in trade, especially in cotton.\u00a0 This industrial city has beheld some extreme and admiring environment in its early years.\u00a0 One can turn different chapters of its biography including dynamic cultures, rise in trade, economic balance, and war for the rule.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s recall the incidents that occurred in the city and relive the eventful history of Ahmedabad by scrolling down the pages.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Ahmedabad History &#8211; Origin, Mighty Maratha &amp; British<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><strong>Origin of Ahmedabad<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Gujarat happened to be an important territory of the Muslim Muzaffarid dynasty at the beginning of the 15th century. The legend says that once Sultan Ahmed Shah was walking around River Sabarmati and witnessed an improbable moment. He saw a little hare was chasing a vicious dog which is quite unreal as it\u2019s the other way around. He was completely numb to see this incident and called upon his spiritual advisor to know a better understanding of it.<\/p>\n<p>The advisor explained it as a miracle of this fascinated land that develops such uniqueness among humans as well as animals. His words stunned the Sultan and then he commanded his ministers to announce Ahmedabad as the capital of his kingdom.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The claim of Solankis<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The archaeologists revealed some super magnificent and interesting facts about the history of Ahmedabad. The city was called Ashapalli ruled by the Bhil kings during the 10th century and in the next century, Bhil received a challenge to save their throne. An inevitable challenge occurred between Bhil Kings and Solanki ruler Karandev. Solanki\u2019s were the vanquishers of this battle and their rule continued in the city till the 13th century. Vaghela rulers dethroned Solanki\u2019s in the 13th century and established their kingdom.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Footprints of the Sultanate<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Sultan Ahmed Shah, a great ruler of the Sultanate Empire of Gujarat contributed a lot towards the development of this city. Muhammad Begada, the grandson of Sultan Ahmed when took charge of the kingdom started the construction of a huge wall to secure the city from its enemies. The outer wall of this protection boundary was almost 6 kilometers long with 12 intricately designed gates installed in it.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the Sultanate Empire of Gujarat couldn&#8217;t rule over the city for a long time and Muhammad Begada became the last ruler of this dynasty.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The Mughals invasion<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In 1573, the Sultanate&#8217;s rule was crushed aside by Akbar, the great Mughal ruler. If Mughals would not have ruled over this beautiful city then Ahmedabad had never have been called as \u2018Manchester of India\u2019. It was the period of Mughal rule only when the textile industry was getting acknowledged and the trade was paramount. Under the rule of Jahangir, Akbar\u2019s son, the city even exported overseas.<\/p>\n<p>However, it was Jahangir only who mocked this place as garbage ground and titled this city as Gardabad- the city of dust. The idea of constructing Moti Shahi Mahal standing tall in the city was fabricated by this popular Mughal ruler only.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The Mighty Maratha<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>An archenemy to the Mughals and an essential part of the rich history of Ahmedabad, The Maratha was a huge empire that transformed the city drastically. Undoubtedly, Maratha kings were the only ones who stood as a stone in the way of Mughals to take complete control in India. Damaji Gaekwad and Raghunath Rao were the two great Maratha rulers who snatched the city from the Mughal chains and declared it as their terrain.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the internal disputes among the Marathas reached south and resulted in an all-out battle that brought fire and brimstone to this city. In fact, the entire city was destroyed and devastated by this mutiny. One can witness the influence of Marathi culture in the city by exploring the historical lineage.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The British era of wine and roses<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you go through Indian history then you will get to know that the British took command of this city in the year 1818. It was the time when soldiers were appointed, the order was established, a government was built and in simple words, we can say that they were trying to reconstruct Ahmedabad. Railway lines were also established during British rule and the invention of the rail route opened up huge possibilities to endless opportunities. This is how the city started exporting textiles to other cities and overseas.<\/p>\n<p>There is nothing to deny the fact that every empire that rises comes to fall gradually and the same happened with the British kingdom also. After ruling over the city for many years, their empire came to an end and a new government was formed.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>An essence of independence<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The art of Satyagraha was conceptualized and nurtured In Ahmedabad itself and later taught to the different parts of the country. The city is also home to some serious freedom fighters and leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi. The legendary Salt March was initiated from this place and there is a lot more to know about this palate.<\/p>\n<p>In simple words, we can conclude that the city played its part flawlessly and ignited the fire of independence in every state. Post-Independence, the city was termed as a temporary part of Bombay. Later, on 1st May 1960, Ahmedabad was declared as part of Gujarat and entitled as the capital city. After a few years, Gandhinagar became the capital city of the state.<\/p>\n<p>At present, this beautiful city in West India excels in many sectors and serves as a major holiday destination and it is home to several UNESCO Heritage Sites.
