Lovingly referred to as the \u2018land of spices, Indian spices are world-renowned for their delicious taste and spicy touch it adds to every meal. There have been numerous attacks by invaders in India because of which several spices were also welcomed and included in everyday life.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to Andhra the people here utilize the local produce and locally grown spices and other food resources. Andhra cuisine is known for its fiery spice and tangy taste that leaves a lasting remark on your memories. If you are traveling to Vizag, Hyderabad, or anywhere in Andhra, these are some must-try foods that will make your trip even better!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1. Hyderabadi Biryani<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Topping the list of some of the best and must-try foods in Andhra is Hyderabadi biryani. It has to be one of the most popular Indian cuisines in India. This Mughlai delight represents the rich blend of aromatic spices, Mughlai traditions, and delicious masalas. Due to its popularity, the people of Hyderabad have also included vegetarian and non-vegetarian options for everyone to enjoy the authenticity of Hyderabad and Andhra as a whole. Some of the best Hyderabad biryani delicacies can be found in the deep gullies, lanes, and by-lanes located around Charminar.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Pulasa Pulusu<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Andhra Pradesh is a coastal state so it is understandable that fish and seafood is loved by all. For those who don\u2019t know, Pulasa is the costliest fish found in Andhra and is savored mainly by the wealthy and rich folks of the south. This fish curry dish is made from a very rare kind of seasonal fish that is cooked to perfection with other interesting flavor-packed ingredients like tamarind, okra, green chilies, and other local spices. The curry is also spiced up with select masalas, garlic, coriander, and curry leaves, some variations of the recipe include a bit of Jaggery and mango pickle oil.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Gutti Vankaya Kura<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Gutti Vankaya is one of the most popular Andhra cuisines which is made up of stuffed Brinjal and is often savored with steamed white rice or Chapati. The flavor profile is extremely nutty and spicy at the same time since the dish includes ground nuts and dried red chilies responsible for the nutty tang of the whole dish. Small Brinjals are then cut up and stuffed with the tangy masala that also includes cut-up coconut, lemon juice, and coriander seeds. Did you know that the locals of Andhra also like to eat this Brinjal Dish with Hyderabadi Biryani?<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. Gongura Pachadi<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Any Andhra cuisine remains incomplete without the accompaniment of a delicious chutney or Achaar which is sort of the defining feature of every south Indian Dish. Chutneys in Andhra are known as Pachadi which is one of the most unique chutneys made out of spinach. This chutney is way tangier than the pickle version that is a tasty delight for your taste buds. Gongura is a type of red sorrel leaves that is combined with red Chillies, garlic, and other basic spices famous in the Andhra region.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5. Gongura Mutton<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The meat and non-vegetarian preparations in Andhra have a fan base of their own. Every meat preparation in Andhra displays a unique style and taste which cannot be replicated anywhere else and Gongura mutton is one of the most delicious ones. If you are a non-vegetarian then this dish will leave a lasting impact. The mutton is cooked to perfection in a base of masala red chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, and ginger garlic in a pressure cooker. Sorrel leaves or Gonguro are added to the dish which adds a great deal of fiery tanginess and enriches the flavor of the dish as a whole.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>6. Natu Kodi Pulusu<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to chicken dishes, Natu Kodi Pulusu of Andhra should not be missed. This spicy Desi chicken recipe is made using authentic spices and ground-up thick gravy using traditionally and locally sourced masalas. This is a protein-packed, healthy dish that is made using poppy seeds, coconut pieces, aromatic whole spices, and a bunch of other ground-up spices which are fried thoroughly before adding the chicken. The yogurt and red chilies further adds a rich creamy texture along with a delicious hint of balanced tanginess.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>7. Akura Pappu<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Akura or Palakura Pappu is a very simple, easy, and hassle-free lentil dal dish that is prepared by most households in Andhra. By far it is clear that the local Andhra people love eating greens, especially spinach and Gongura and they love including it in any of their dishes ranging from Dals to pickles and chutneys. The star of the dish is spinach which is added in the last step of the dal making process so that it doesn\u2019t lose its taste or texture.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>8. Pesarattu<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You may have had Dosas in past but Pesarattu takes a regular Dosa game to a whole new level. Made with a batter of whole green gram and a variety of spices, Pesarattu is one of the healthiest and most loved choices of breakfast for the people of Andhra. It can be called a breakfast crepe whose stuffing can be anything of your liking ranging from just onion and tomatoes to the regular potato stuffing. It is mainly eaten in breakfast because it can be made with the least amount of effort and is very filling.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>9. Punugulu<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Eaten primarily as a snack, Punugulu is a delicious and crunchy fried Idli batter that is a tea-time favorite among the locals and should definitely be tried during your Andhra visit. To make this, whole Moong grams are soaked and then ground in a batter with thick consistency along with a couple of other spices. It is then laid out bit by bit in a piping hot pan to make thin, spicy, and crispy crepes. Some people also soak the yellow Moong dal for 1 hour in some hot water to make the quick and hassle-free version of this dish.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to food and trying out delicacies, Andhra has a myriad of options to offer for everyone. From some chutneys, pickles, and beverages to highly complex and skillful meals preparations, this place is every foodie\u2019s dream destination.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"cmsmasters_column one_fourth sidefrBt\">\n<div class=\"cmsmasters_sidebar sidebar_layout_11\"><aside id=\"text-8\" class=\"widget widget_text\">\t\t\t<div class=\"textwidget\"><div class=\"sidefrBt\">\n\n<div class=\"wpcf7 no-js\" id=\"wpcf7-f26619-o1\" lang=\"en-US\" dir=\"ltr\" data-wpcf7-id=\"26619\">\n<div class=\"screen-reader-response\"><p role=\"status\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-atomic=\"true\"><\/p> <ul><\/ul><\/div>\n<form action=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/29481#wpcf7-f26619-o1\" method=\"post\" class=\"wpcf7-form init\" aria-label=\"Contact form\" novalidate=\"novalidate\" data-status=\"init\">\n<div style=\"display: none;\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7\" value=\"26619\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_version\" value=\"6.0\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_locale\" value=\"en_US\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_unit_tag\" value=\"wpcf7-f26619-o1\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_container_post\" value=\"0\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wpcf7_posted_data_hash\" value=\"\" \/>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"sidFrm\" class=\"pricBxt\">\n\t<div class=\"ratBxt\">\n\t\t<p>Get a Best Deal Quick Enquiry\n\t\t<\/p>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<div class=\"itenBxt\">\n\t\t<p><span id=\"wpcf7-673c3dcdb321d-wrapper\" class=\"wpcf7-form-control-wrap website_fill-wrap\" style=\"display:none !important;
