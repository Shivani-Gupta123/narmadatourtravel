The dish is simple with no vegetables; it does not contain a lengthy list of ingredients. The dish depicted the simplicity and resilience of Pahadi cooking. In the harsh climate of the mountains, Garhwali people eat Kafuli to keep themselves warm and healthy.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Bhang Ki Chutney<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Bhang Ki Chutney is a very popular dish of Uttarakhand. Locally known as Bhang or Bhangjeera, these seeds are available only in Uttaranchal. The chutney can be served at any time of the day and loved by local people. It doesn\u2019t taste like usual chutney, it has strong flavours.

The Pahadi people mix this dal with cooked rice known as Baadi. It has high nutritional value and has immense utility to make you feel healthy. It is prepared by roasting Kali Urad Ki Dal and grinding it into powder. The mixture is then cooked with only indigenous Indian spices like peppercorns, red chilies, etc. in an iron pot over low flames releasing the earthy aroma. Along with numerous other great qualities, the dal also has a high amount of proteins. The spices that form part of the ingredients leave a pleasing sharp smell. Chainsoo is a typical winter dish for the Pahari people in Uttaranchal and can be teamed up either with steamed rice or roti.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5. Mandua Ki Roti<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Mandua Ki Roti is a very healthy Pahadi dish you must try in Auli.
