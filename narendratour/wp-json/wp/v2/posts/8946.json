There are many wonderful places here which have been drawing tourists and spiritual seekers for a long time. Though mostly known for Hindu temples and mysticism Uttar Pradesh has a deep connection to Buddhism. Sarnath and Kushinagar have an abiding link to the life of Gautama Buddha. Buddhist and seekers of religion have visited Uttar Pradesh since the ancient ages to visit Varanasi along with Sarnath and Kushinagar. The latter two places are quite close to the Nepal border and thus draw a lot of tourists from cross-border areas.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Buddhist in Uttar Pradesh<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>It is well known that Bihar was the seat of Gautam Buddha\u2019s realization of the divine truth and many of its areas have different significant meanings for the Buddhists. It&#8217;s said that after attaining Nirvana\u2026Lord Buddha meditated for seven whole weeks in the same spot and then began his journey towards Uttar Pradesh in quest of his fellow seekers. As soon his companions saw him they were struck by the glowing divinity on the face of Buddha. The Lord Buddha convinced his companions about the path of Knowledge and his famous concept of the middle path of life. His companions gained enlightenment and this first sermon laid the solid foundation of the Buddhist in Uttar Pradesh. The subsequent 45 years of the life of Gautam Buddha till the event of his Mahanirvana were spent in different areas of Uttar Pradesh.<\/p>\n<p>It should be noted that numerous Indian rulers like Ashoka and Gupta (they belonged to the Mauryan clan) promoted Buddhism fully. Ashoka who used to be a valiant and fierce warrior was deeply influenced by the teachings of Buddha and reincarnated himself as a saint and seeker of peace after his conversion to Buddhism. Emperor Ashoka was responsible for erecting the Dharma inscriptions of Buddhism on the pillars and rocks on various areas of U.P. He also built stupas and temples but many of these were destroyed by the Turks and Arabs who invaded these lands in the 12th century. In the 19th century to 20th century Buddhism, as a religion was again revived in India and Uttar Pradesh, was made a prominent spiritual destination.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Important Buddhist Pilgrimage Spots<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><strong>Sarnath: &#8211;<\/strong> Very close to the Hindu holy destination Varanasi, Sarnath is on the must visit the list of most Buddhists over the world.
