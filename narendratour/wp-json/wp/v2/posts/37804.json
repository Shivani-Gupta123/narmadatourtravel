As per one story, Diwali\u2019s origin lies in the Ramayana where Lord Ram returns to Ayodhya and people celebrate the arrival with lighting diyas. Today it is known as the festival of lights Diwali. People in the hills didn\u2019t get the news of Ram\u2019s arrival instantly. The news of his arrival reached the hills after 11 days. This belief suggests that the news of this event gained them 11 days. Hence, it is called Diwali Igas. Another story, however, speaks of the victory of Veer Bhad Madho Singh Bhandari from Garhwal in Tibet coincidentally 11 days after Diwali, it leads to another festival known as Igas.<\/p>\n<p>Through the Igas Diwali, communities worship some of its deities who celebrate Bhailo, an old game where participants put small bundles of wood for fires.
