Located in Gujarat this temple is a true testament to the sheer hard work and persistent ambition to honor Indian culture. Having been through an extremely tumultuous past with several loots and plunders, today Somnath stands tall by the crashing waves of the Arabian Sea, as one of the most exquisite and pious places of Shiva worship.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The Mythology of Somnath Temple<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The light and sound show that is featured during the nighttime tells the spiritual and mythological background of this majestic pilgrimage place. The term som translates into the moon, meaning the temple is dedicated to the moon lord. The moon lord himself had prayed to lord shiva at the very place where the temple stands now. The story starts off with the moon being married to 27 of Raja Daksha&#8217;s daughters. Instead of giving his time equally to all his wives, he devoted most of his time to just one wife &#8211; Rohini. This made the father, Daksh, very angry. He cursed the moon that it would lose all its glowing lustre and would fade away. Sadly, the moon started fading away.<\/p>\n<p>A worried moon made its way to this spot in Somnath along with Rohini and started praying to lord shiva. Happy with his dedication and devotion the Lord freed him from the curse. The moon then took a dip in the holy Saraswati River which revived his faded glow and lustre. The first temple structure was built by the moon god himself who had dedicated it to lord shiva.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>History of Somnath Temple<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There is no exact date for the construction of the very first structure of Somnath temple. The earliest history of this 1st Shiva Jyotirlinga dates back to 649 CE during the reign of the Yadava kings i.e. the Vallabh is. This was destroyed by the Arab governor of Sindh during his invasions in Rajasthan and Gujarat. He broke the jyotirlinga and took away 20 million dinars. Another plundering took place in 1299 by Alauddin Khilji\u2019s army led by Ulugh Khan. The temple was again built in 1308 before getting destroyed once again during the late 14th century. In 1665 Mughal emperor Aurangzeb demolished the temple and passed the law that if Hindus tried to erect it again, it should be demolished completely. During 1950-51 the temple was rebuilt (current structure) due to the efforts made by Sardar Patel and Mahatma Gandhi.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What to Expect?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The temple is covered all over with fresh, bright flowers among other gold and silver ornaments. This gives a very traditional, spiritual, and holy vibe to the whole complex. This is also done keeping in mind the legend related to the temple. Som or the moon god built the temple using gold, later on, Ravan built it by silver and Lord Krishna built the temple by wood. Every feature symbolizes some aspect of our rich cultural heritage.
