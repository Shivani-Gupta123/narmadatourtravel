Why would our customers keep returning to us and recommend our services to their loved ones? Why do our customers consider us their trustworthy and resourceful friends who can safely handle all the nuances of any trip so gracefully? That we are able to inspire such trust in our esteemed customers, that we get to accompany them in their moments of utter bliss on sacred voyages, that we get to become a part of the memories they cherish throughout their lives, inspires us to strive to become better in what we do, with every trip, with every traveler.

Why don\u2019t you listen to the stories from our guests themselves of their journeys we had a privilege planning for them?<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row full_width=&#8221;stretch_row&#8221; gap=&#8221;5&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1530177284518{margin-bottom: 0px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column width=&#8221;3\/4&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>Reviews for : All Services<\/h2>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner el_class=&#8221;saying-traveler&#8221; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1515410896890{background-color: #f8f8f8 !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/4&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1515412078498{border-right-width: 1px !important;border-right-color: #f1eaea !important;border-right-style: solid !important;border-radius: 1px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_text]Travellers rating<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-9119\" src=\"https:\/\/www.namasteindiatrip.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/star-rating-300x66.png\" alt=\"star-rating\" width=\"100\" height=\"30\" loading=\"lazy\" \/><\/p>\n<p>4.3 of 5 stars<\/p>\n<p>Based on 4305 Reviews<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/4&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1515412114003{border-right-width: 1px !important;border-right-color: #f1eaea !important;border-right-style: solid !important;border-radius: 1px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h5>58%<\/h5>\n<h5>Excellent<\/h5>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/4&#8243; css=&#8221;.vc_custom_1515412130153{border-right-width: 1px !important;border-right-color: #f1eaea !important;border-right-style: solid !important;border-radius: 1px !important;}&#8221;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h5>38%<\/h5>\n<h5>Very Good<\/h5>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=&#8221;1\/4&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h5>8%<\/h5>\n<h5>Average<\/h5>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text]\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"testimonials_list_area\"><div id=\"ktsttestimonial_list_style\"><div class=\"client_names\"> MANJMA H K PRAJIT <\/div><div class=\"client_names_photo\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/secure.gravatar.com\/avatar\/?s=96&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\"><\/div><div class=\"client_content\"><span class=\"laquo\">&nbsp;<\/span> We had a wonderful, very well organized trip.

I was so curious about exploring the place, it was so amazing. It is a very good destination for couples. We had so much fun in Manali. The hotel we stayed in provided us really good room service. The activities conducted were superb and we were not even charged for them. Our tour Manager  was a great Human being, we really enjoyed travelling with him, he was very soft spoken, approachable and humble . Even Chinmay was very cooperative and helpful. Our guided the tour in the best possible way. I would definitely ask my friends and family to consider Namaste India Trip atleast once in their life.

I have been on couple of other tours (international as well domestic) with Namaste India Trip but this was the best experience I have ever had. The itinerary for this tour is superb and gives you enough desired relaxation time apart from covering all the sightseeing places. The food and the hotels were excellent especially the food and service at Grand Mumtaz, Pahalgam. The travel was well spread so as to not let it take a toll on our health. The tour like all other Namaste India Trip was very well coordinated right from the pick-up till the drop at the airport with 100% attention to the comfort of the guests. At Gulmarg my mom was not feeling well and we didn\u2019t have the required medicine. Rohan and Hrishikesh ensured that we got the medicine for which they had to walk to a medical store almost 3 kms away in the evening. Also, our travel to Pahalgam was delayed due to traffic jams and road blocks and the lunch spot was quite far. They got us biscuits and Tea so that we don\u2019t stay hungry. Throughout the trip both of them were extremely patient, co-operative, enthusiastic, informative and helpful. Also thanks to all our group members, they were fantastic. Once again thanks a lot to Namaste India Trip for providing us such wonderful experience.

The tour plan was comprehensive, we saw all the spots and several places that were off the beaten path. Cab was fine, hotels were very good. Before starting i was suspecting about hotels but they assured me about hotel and really services of hotels were fabulous as well as houseboat.
